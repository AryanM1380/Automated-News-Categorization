      "Content Sample: Money talks, and no one knows this better than the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It’s how the Trump Administration communicates with its enemies, as well as with its allies – through the application powerful long-range financial instruments. But Europe is moving in for another attempt at breaking Washington’s blockade of Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After ripping up the JCPOA Iran Nuclear Deal in May 2018, the US began constructing a comprehensive global economic blockade designed to starve and break the Iranian economy. Of course, no one is happier about this than Israel (arguably, the architect of the JCPOA sabotage), along with regional rival Saudi Arabia. If Washington choking-off Iran wasn’t enough, it has also also vowed to sanction anyone who dared to trade with Iran. In the fall of 2018, Europe tried to bypass this by devising an alternative clearing mechanism for financial transactions for avoiding using the US dollar, called the “Special Purpose Vehicle” (SPV). When the US nixed it, it seemed any chance for an economic lifeline for Iran was off the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Europe seems to be determined to try and bypass the ramparts of American economic statecraft. This week France, Germany and the UK have announced the creation of a new payment system is called INSTEX – short for ‘Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges’, to be based in Paris. This new improved version of the previous ‘SPV’ vehicle, now ready to facilitate “legitimate trade” with Iran by bypassing any US dollar transactions, and with an initial focus on crucial goods like food and medical supplies. Later on, organisers hope to expand its capabilities to cover all goods and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their official joint statement, the working group have indicated that they will seek to expand the number of countries using this new channel. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of this week’s INSTEX announcement, the question now remains whether of not Mnuchin’s sanctions armada will pursue European countries attempting to bust Washington’s unilateral measures. While the INSTEX may provide the framework for a viable work-around, it is still yet to be seen just how many companies will want to risk drawing the gaze of Washington’s financial eye of mordor. In other words, a company like Thyssenkrupp could deliver product to Iran via INSTEX, but by doing so they may risk losing their access to the lucrative US market – should Washington decide to punish the German corporation for its insubordination. No doubt firms will be deploying teams of lobbyists to Washington in search of exemption wavers. This same risk applies to small to medium size enterprises too, although smaller players cannot afford Washington’s pay-to-play lobby game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately after the initial Special Purpose Vehicle, or “SPV” idea was floated in Brussels this past fall, the US immediately began threatening to sanction anyone who defied its decree by continuing to trade with Iran. France, Germany and the EU itself, had vowed to bust Trump’s Iran sanctions through the SPV.  This is an important concept, because it signals the first deliberate move by major state actors to move away from the US dollar as a world reserve currency. The reserve currency issue is paramount because it’s one of the fundamental prerequisites in transitioning from a unipolar world order with America in the cat bird seat, to establishing what many analysts and international relations scholars refer to as a ‘multipolar world order’ with power-sharing arrangements among ‘multiple equals.’ Naturally, the US was having none of it, and proceeded to threatened to sanction the international inter-bank financial messaging clearing system known as SWIFT, based in Belgium. Trump’s éminence grise and master of the coin, the US Treasury Secretary Dept’s resident Little Finger, Steve Mnuchin, then threw down the gauntlet to the Brussels rebellion saying, “We have advised SWIFT that it must disconnect any Iranian financial institutions that we designate as soon as technologically feasible to avoid sanctions exposure.” And that was that. No more SPV for the Europe’s multipolar crusaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will INSTEX meet a similar fate? That depends on whether the European partners have the political will and determination to see this initiative through to the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington is certain to launch a counter move in order to try and intimidate western corporations from participating in trade with Iran, so onus is really on France, Germany and the UK to prove they have the stones to stand to Trump and be ready to elevate this issue to the UNSC level – and openly challenge the US on principle, and international law, something they have not yet been willing to do, and thus reducing any independent EU actions to remain merely symbolic and ‘good natured’, but never implemented to the point of being effective. They could start by asking Washington and Tel Aviv to present the evidence that they claim to have and which proves that Iran is in breach of the JCPOA by still pursuing a nuclear weapon. To date, no such evidence has been produced, other than a bizarre off-Broadway show and Powerpoint presentation delivered by Bibi Netanyahu. Team Europe has to be ready to tell Trump: put up, or shut up, and we’ll see you in court. If they aren’t, then their status as an offshore outpost of the US will persist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse than that, the EU will continue to be a paper tiger in terms of its federalist foreign policy aspirations. If Brussels and its member states are unable to pursue a foreign policy independent of Washington’s, then it will be another nail in the coffin of the European Project.\n",

It was not immediately clear whether Ginsburg would return to the bench later this week.\n",

This year’s Cenotaph-adjacent vein-busters were basically the same as the previous years: “Fury as Jeremy Corbyn fails to shave his head and paint ‘LEST WE FORGET’ across his skull in poppy-red face paint” – and I, for one, am calling for fresh story lines. Nearby, Boris Johnson looked, frankly, as if he’d left my house at 10am in an Uber with a can of Dark Fruit for the road “to perk one up”. He looked like I’d been begging him to get two hours sleep – mate, please, you can use my bed, honestly – but he insists on playing The xx remixes off YouTube instead. Keeps asking me how the PlayStation controller works and whether it is possible to close any more curtains. His phone’s on 1% because he keeps Googling what time the shops open. That sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only… oh? The footage of the wreath-laying on BBC Breakfast on Monday morning showed a markedly fresher-faced Johnson, laying a different coloured wreath, the right way up this time, and looking, well, as if he didn’t have an entry-stamp to The Dolphin on his inner wrist and £60 in notes in his wallet just in case. Eagle-eyed viewers immediately noticed the discrepancy, and the BBC issued a short mea culpa: the line they stuck to was that footage of the 2016 wreath-laying, prepared for a preview of the 2019 wreath laying, was accidentally used instead of footage of the 2019 ceremony. And because it’s 2019 we all accepted the apology and moved on. Ah, sorry, my mistake, no: because it’s 2019 we’re still talking about it days later and will continue to for many days and possibly years to come.\n",

      "Are there lessons from what history will refer to as #Wreathgate?

Very hard to tell.\n",

      "On the other hand: if you’ve ever seen a nerd in a dark room editing video you would realise how particularly difficult it would be to reach three years back into the archives and accidentally splice one shot in among the fresh stuff – it is simply too many mouse-clicks to fathom. On a third hand, which is a thing: Rob Burley, the editor for BBC live political programmes and unlikely star of this election so far, came out and tweeted a Big And Bruising denial (“wave upon wave of insulting, self-righteous and hysterical tweets keep on coming because people really want it to be true”), which perversely makes me believe the conspiracy more. I don’t know what to do.\n",

Do you know how many high-functioning online entire subreddits dedicated to this there are? Do you know how on edge we all are after the whole Epstein thing? In 2016, American conspiracy heads got carried away and fired a rifle in a pizza parlour because it didn’t have a big enough basement. We’re not in the mood for this any more.

The strict 10.30am cut-off that currently exists works on two levels: it gets hungover people out of bed with some sort of deadline to work to, and it means cooks don’t have to keep a fried egg warm all day in an over-capacity kitchen.

      "\n",
      "In fact, retirement includes so many important, potentially irreversible decisions that most people could benefit from a few sessions with a fee-only, fiduciary financial planner. (Fiduciary means the adviser is committed to putting your interests ahead of their own.) These ideally would start about 10 years before retirement. Understanding some key concepts could make those discussions easier — or keep you from making serious mistakes if you take a do-it-yourself approach.\n",

      "Social Security will make up 60% to 80% of most retirees’ income, so maximizing those checks is essential, says actuary Steve Vernon, a consulting research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security checks can start at age 62, but abundant research shows most people are better off delaying. Waiting until 70, when benefits max out, is typically the optimal strategy for single people and the higher wage earner in a couple, says Vernon, author of “Retirement Game-Changers.” People’s situations can vary, though, so they would be smart to consult Social Security calculators to help them decide when to start. AARP’s site has a free one, or search for more sophisticated versions from Maximize My Social Security ($40 and up) and Social Security Solutions ($20 and up).\n",
      "\n",
      "A planner might recommend tapping retirement accounts or working just enough to substitute for the income you would otherwise receive from Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, fixed expenses in retirement would be covered by guaranteed income, such as Social Security and pensions, so that your basic lifestyle isn’t jeopardized by stock market fluctuations. If those sources aren’t enough to cover basic costs, an income annuity could help fill the gap, says certified financial analyst Wade Pfau, author of “Safety-First Retirement Planning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Income annuities are insurance products that can offer a lifetime stream of monthly payments in exchange for a lump sum. Unlike variable annuities or other investments, the amount you get doesn’t vary if the stock market goes up or down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another option could be a reverse mortgage, a loan that can convert some of your home equity into a stream of monthly checks. If you have a lot of equity but still have a mortgage, a reverse mortgage could pay off your loan and eliminate those monthly payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial planners’ “4% rule” suggests withdrawing 4% of your portfolio the first year, adjusting the amount each year afterward for inflation. This strategy historically has posed a low risk of running out of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some planners, however, worry that 4% may be too high given current low interest rates and high stock valuations. The “Spend Safely in Retirement” method, which Vernon created with the help of the Society of Actuaries, recommends using annual withdrawal rates based on the IRS’ required minimum distribution rules. The percentage rises slightly each year according to age. A 60-year-old might withdraw 2.72%, a 65-year-old would tap 3.13% and a 70-year-old would take 3.65%. The withdrawal would be made at the end of each year, then the money is moved into a savings account or other investment that protects the principal, so it’s available to spend the following year without risk of market losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the 4% rule, the “Spend Safely in Retirement” approach poses no risk of running out of money but can result in income that varies considerably from year to year. Retirees who have their basic expenses covered by guaranteed income might look at their portfolio income as a bonus, Vernon says. A bigger one can pay for splurges, while a smaller bonus might require cutting discretionary spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many retirees are tempted to move their money into “safe” investments such as bonds, certificates of deposit or savings accounts. Unfortunately, those investments may not keep up with inflation over time. Devoting at least 50% of investment portfolios to stocks — ideally using a low-cost target date, balanced or stock index fund — can produce more income over time, Vernon says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you create a retirement paycheck, your work isn’t done. You’ll still need emergency funds for unexpected expenses and a strategy to pay for long-term care, among other tasks. But establishing a reliable income stream can help you meet your regular expenses in retirement without worrying you’ll run out of cash.\n",

      "Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn't have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Though we don't have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it's not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,\" he said. \"Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.\"\n",

      "But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a \"calculated political move\" by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.\n",

      "It would have been different, Anderson said, if Trump had signed a Bible out of the limelight for someone with whom he had a close connection.\n",

People should have more respect for Scripture.\"\n",

But the tragedy quickly descended into a media-driven political campaign with accusations of astroturfing as critics accusing Democratic Party operatives and media outlets like CNN and MSNBC of using the students not only to gain political leverage by using the gun issue in such an emotive setting – but also as a platform to help register Democratic Party voters for the upcoming 2018 Midterm Elections in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the confusion about multiple arrests, there are also competing narratives in the media about which extremist camp which protagonist Tarrant belongs to. Most media outlets are framing Tarrant as a “White Supremacist” due to the symbolism which has appeared in a loose collection of extremist writings, internet ranting, free association comments, and images – in what the media are calling a “manifesto”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictably, CNN’s Don Lemon and Max Boot were pinning the blame on Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "His weapon was scrawled with neo-Nazi symbols and the names of white right-wing extremists who had killed others because of their ethnicity or faith. A manifesto released online laid his motivations out to bare: to kill Muslim immigrants. Seven other people were killed at another mosque nearby, bringing the toll of the two attacks to 49 people, a brutal act of terrorism that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a closer look into the symbolism in his paraphernalia reveals a real possibility of connections to right-wing fascist militant groups based in Ukraine – part of the same NeoNazi and fascist movement which was given political and material backing by the Obama Administration and John McCain in order to help carry out Washington’s violent coup in Kiev in February 2014. In this scenario, it’s possible that Tarrant could have been radicalized overseas and also online.\n",
      "\n",
      ".\n",
      "\n",
      " Apparently, Tarrant also made the reference “For Rotherham” on his ammunition clips (pictured above), a nod to the UK town of which was the sight of the ‘Rotherham Asian Grooming‘ sex abuse scandal, one of the stories championed by infamous British right-wing political actor Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon). Other references to right-wing criminal folklore were also made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Top ranked US talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has attempted to flip this theory, claiming that Tarrant is a leftist agitator trying to discredit the right:\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s an ongoing theory that the shooter himself may in fact be a leftist who writes the manifesto and then goes out and performs the deed purposely to smear his political enemies, knowing he’s going to get shot in the process.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More than any other single mass shooting or terrorist event in recent years, the Christchurch event closely resembles the 2011 Norway Massacre carried out by right-wing Mason, Templar and Christian Zionist, Anders Breivik (Note: Breivik was also linked to Tommy Robinson, see here and here) were he massacred 77 members of Norway’s Young Labour Party at a Workers’ Youth League (AUF) summer camp (Note that Young Labor were dedicated supporters of Palestinian at that time and opposed the Israeli occupation).\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like Breivik’s 2012 Norway Attack,  Tarrant’s Christchurch event also featured two separate venues on the same day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, both men are said to have prepared a manifesto before their operations. In Tarrant’s 74-page document posted online, he claims to want to create “an atmosphere of fear” which would incite Muslims and trigger a right-wing counter-reactions, but then turns to say “CONSERVATISM IS DEAD, THANK GOD.” This is just one of the many nonsensical twists and turns in this seemingly incoherent ‘manifesto.’  The document also pays homage to American Dylann Roof and other mass shooters, and seemed to infer that Tarrant himself had had received Breivik’s “blessing” for this latest mass shooting and terrorist attack in Christchurch.\n",
      "\n",
      "As 21WIRE reported back in 2011, the Norway Massacre was a catalyst for extremist right-wing fascism and  terrorism, and that future extremists like Tarrant would indeed be inspired by the bravado of Breivik.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted also that in the case of Breivik, his initial processing and police interview was held in secret and not recorded, and therefore no public record of what was said can be analyzed. Similarly with the Christchurch Shooting, hearings on the Saturday were held in closed session with Judge Paul Keller denying any open, public access, supposedly “in the interest of safety” — an unusual move for New Zealand courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the high-profile mass shootings and terror attacks in recent years have featured a leading actor who was a “known wolf” – some one who was already ‘on the radar’ of the security services as a known extremist or informant, as opposed to a merely a lone wolf. This does not appear to be the case in Christchurch. According to reports, authorities in both Australia and New Zealand did not have Tarrant listed on any counter-terrorism watch list, despite the currently theory that he was planning the attack for several years.\n",

      "Content Sample: A group of employees from 13 McDonald’s restaurants in Chicago filed a lawsuit Thursday alleging that the company’s drive for profits puts workers at “daily risk” of physical attack by dangerous customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the lawsuit filed in Cook County court, the 17 workers say McDonald’s has failed to protect them from what they say is a “citywide and nationwide” pattern of violence and that police respond to more than 20 911 calls every day regarding Chicago McDonald’s restaurants. They cite several examples of the violence, including an incident in which a customer beat an employee with a sign and another in which a customer urinated on a worker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“McDonald’s has failed, at a systemic level, to protect its workers from violence in the workplace,” said Danny Rosenthal, an attorney for the workers. “Throughout the country, McDonald’s workers are regularly threatened, assaulted, and injured by customers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "McDonald’s did not respond to the lawsuit’s specific allegations, but it said in a statement that, “McDonald’s takes seriously its responsibility to provide and foster a safe working environment for our employees, and along with our franchisees, continue to make investments in training programs that uphold safe environments for customers and crew members.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit contends that in its effort to increase profits, McDonald’s has taken steps that have made working at its restaurants more dangerous. For example, it alleges that by lowering and tearing down physical barriers at check-out counters, the company has made it easier for dangerous customers to attack workers. McDonald’s has also ignored the “recommended practice” of designing drive-thru windows so that customers cannot crawl through them, according to the lawsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because McDonald’s does not allow workers to lock bathroom doors when they are sent there to clean them, the company puts workers at greater risk of sexual violence, the lawsuit asserts. One of the plaintiffs “was cleaning inside the men’s bathroom when men entered and exposed themselves to her in a sexual manner,” it states.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit marks the latest in a string of legal problems for the fast food giant. McDonald’s has faced protests and dozens of lawsuits over what workers call sexual harassment at its restaurants and the company’s failure to address their complaints. Earlier this month, a former employee sued McDonald’s and one of its Michigan franchisees, alleging that the general manager did nothing to stop a co-worker from groping and physically assaulting her. And just days before that lawsuit was filed, McDonald’s fired its CEO, Steve Easterbrook, for having a consensual romantic relationship with an employee.\n",

      "Content Sample: Money talks, and no one knows this better than the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It’s how the Trump Administration communicates with its enemies, as well as with its allies – through the application powerful long-range financial instruments. But Europe is moving in for another attempt at breaking Washington’s blockade of Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After ripping up the JCPOA Iran Nuclear Deal in May 2018, the US began constructing a comprehensive global economic blockade designed to starve and break the Iranian economy. Of course, no one is happier about this than Israel (arguably, the architect of the JCPOA sabotage), along with regional rival Saudi Arabia. If Washington choking-off Iran wasn’t enough, it has also also vowed to sanction anyone who dared to trade with Iran. In the fall of 2018, Europe tried to bypass this by devising an alternative clearing mechanism for financial transactions for avoiding using the US dollar, called the “Special Purpose Vehicle” (SPV). When the US nixed it, it seemed any chance for an economic lifeline for Iran was off the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Europe seems to be determined to try and bypass the ramparts of American economic statecraft. This week France, Germany and the UK have announced the creation of a new payment system is called INSTEX – short for ‘Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges’, to be based in Paris. This new improved version of the previous ‘SPV’ vehicle, now ready to facilitate “legitimate trade” with Iran by bypassing any US dollar transactions, and with an initial focus on crucial goods like food and medical supplies. Later on, organisers hope to expand its capabilities to cover all goods and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their official joint statement, the working group have indicated that they will seek to expand the number of countries using this new channel. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of this week’s INSTEX announcement, the question now remains whether of not Mnuchin’s sanctions armada will pursue European countries attempting to bust Washington’s unilateral measures. While the INSTEX may provide the framework for a viable work-around, it is still yet to be seen just how many companies will want to risk drawing the gaze of Washington’s financial eye of mordor. In other words, a company like Thyssenkrupp could deliver product to Iran via INSTEX, but by doing so they may risk losing their access to the lucrative US market – should Washington decide to punish the German corporation for its insubordination. No doubt firms will be deploying teams of lobbyists to Washington in search of exemption wavers. This same risk applies to small to medium size enterprises too, although smaller players cannot afford Washington’s pay-to-play lobby game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately after the initial Special Purpose Vehicle, or “SPV” idea was floated in Brussels this past fall, the US immediately began threatening to sanction anyone who defied its decree by continuing to trade with Iran. France, Germany and the EU itself, had vowed to bust Trump’s Iran sanctions through the SPV.  This is an important concept, because it signals the first deliberate move by major state actors to move away from the US dollar as a world reserve currency. The reserve currency issue is paramount because it’s one of the fundamental prerequisites in transitioning from a unipolar world order with America in the cat bird seat, to establishing what many analysts and international relations scholars refer to as a ‘multipolar world order’ with power-sharing arrangements among ‘multiple equals.’ Naturally, the US was having none of it, and proceeded to threatened to sanction the international inter-bank financial messaging clearing system known as SWIFT, based in Belgium. Trump’s éminence grise and master of the coin, the US Treasury Secretary Dept’s resident Little Finger, Steve Mnuchin, then threw down the gauntlet to the Brussels rebellion saying, “We have advised SWIFT that it must disconnect any Iranian financial institutions that we designate as soon as technologically feasible to avoid sanctions exposure.” And that was that. No more SPV for the Europe’s multipolar crusaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will INSTEX meet a similar fate? That depends on whether the European partners have the political will and determination to see this initiative through to the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington is certain to launch a counter move in order to try and intimidate western corporations from participating in trade with Iran, so onus is really on France, Germany and the UK to prove they have the stones to stand to Trump and be ready to elevate this issue to the UNSC level – and openly challenge the US on principle, and international law, something they have not yet been willing to do, and thus reducing any independent EU actions to remain merely symbolic and ‘good natured’, but never implemented to the point of being effective. They could start by asking Washington and Tel Aviv to present the evidence that they claim to have and which proves that Iran is in breach of the JCPOA by still pursuing a nuclear weapon. To date, no such evidence has been produced, other than a bizarre off-Broadway show and Powerpoint presentation delivered by Bibi Netanyahu. Team Europe has to be ready to tell Trump: put up, or shut up, and we’ll see you in court. If they aren’t, then their status as an offshore outpost of the US will persist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse than that, the EU will continue to be a paper tiger in terms of its federalist foreign policy aspirations. If Brussels and its member states are unable to pursue a foreign policy independent of Washington’s, then it will be another nail in the coffin of the European Project.\n",

      "That's a big boost to his fledgling self-declared government, and Mnuchin said these oil sanctions could be completely lifted once Guaidó has full control of PDVSA: \"When there is a recognition that the company is the property of, the rightful rulers, the rightful leaders, then indeed that money will be available to Guaido. We will be working with them on the money in the blocked account and whether that can be used for them.\"\n",

      "The move is sure to even further disrupt Maduro's government, which maintains the loyalty of Venezuela's military top brass but could be left unable to pay them. While a handful of military and diplomatic officials have sworn allegiance to Guaidó in the last week, losing access to Venezuela's coffers could unleash a wave of defections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maduro seemed to be moving to reassert his authority on Monday, offering to meet with President Donald Trump for talks, according to his foreign minister Jorge Arreaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a news conference Monday, Arreaza asserted that the U.S. continues to have diplomatic relations with Maduro's government after recognizing Guaidó, even reading some of the diplomatic notes the U.S. has sent and showing a photo of U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Jimmy Story's meeting with the Vice Chancellor on Saturday.\n",

      "\n",
      "The White House has not responded yet to that offer to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bolton painted a picture of weakening Maduro control on Monday, saying the U.S. knows through \"numerous contacts on the ground\" that the military's rank and file are \"acutely aware of the desperate economic conditions in the country and we think they look for ways to support the National Assembly government.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even among the top brass, he said, there are high-level contacts between the general officers and the opposition -- including among those that posed with the Defense Minister last week as he reiterated his allegiance to Maduro: \"What [the Maduro government] didn't know was how many of them were already talking to the National Assembly,\" he said of that photo-op.\n",
      "\n",
      "A handful of senior Venezuelan military and diplomatic officials in the U.S. have already turned. Maduro said he would break diplomatic ties with the U.S. and close the country's embassy and consulates and ordered all diplomats home. But a handful instead defected to join Guaidó's government, which has promised amnesty to anyone in the military who disavows Maduro and even floated it for Maduro himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Col. José Luis Silva, the military attaché at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, announced he was breaking with Maduro in an interview with the Miami Herald on Saturday, adding, \"My message to all armed forces members, to everyone who carries a gun, is to please let's not attack the people. We are also part of the people, and we've had enough of supporting a government that has betrayed the most basic principles and sold itself to other countries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, another senior official joined him -- the deputy chief of the Venezuelan consulate in Miami, Scarlet Salazar -- posting in a video online where she added, \"This decision abides by my democratic principles and values as a career diplomatic officer serving Venezuela for more than 18 uninterrupted years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. has maintained its own diplomatic presence in the country, even after Maduro said he would give U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The State Department ordered the evacuation of non-emergency staff and families out of concern for their safety, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. would not obey the full order because Maduro was the \"former\" president and his commands were \"illegitimate.\" He left behind a small crew of 25 or so employees, including Chargé d'Affaires Story.\n",
      "\n",
      "That set up a showdown by Sunday morning, with Bolton threatening action: \"Any violence and intimidation against U.S. diplomatic personnel, Venezuela's democratic leader, Juan Guiadó, or the National Assembly itself would represent a grave assault on the rule of law and will be met with a significant response,\" he tweeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Maduro backed down, suspending his order and giving the U.S. 30 days to negotiate or withdraw its remaining personnel. Arreazza added Monday that all Venezuelan diplomats had left the U.S. and the U.S. should also respect the 30-day deadline, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The State Department also announced another staffing change Friday, bringing on Elliott Abrams as a special envoy for Venezuela. Abrams was an Assistant Secretary of State under President Reagan and a Deputy National Security Adviser to President George W. Bush, making him a controversial choice for his role in Reagan's support for Latin American dictatorships, his cover-up of the Iran-Contra affair, and his support for the Iraq War. Abrams pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors for withholding evidence to Congress, but was later pardoned by George H.W. Bush.\n",

      "\n",
      "They had carried signs for 31 days and demonstrated the muscle the United Auto Workers union still has over Detroit's three manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Details of the four-year pact weren't released, but GM's latest offer to end the monthlong strike included wage increases and lump-sum payments, top-notch health insurance at little cost to workers, promises of new products for many U.S. factories and a path to full-time work for temporary workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a big difference from what GM wanted going into the talks: to slash total labor costs at its factories, which are about $13 per hour higher than at foreign automakers in the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terry Dittes, the UAW's chief bargainer with GM, said the deal offers \"major gains\" for 49,000 union workers who have been walking picket lines since Sept. 16. They'll stay off work for at least a couple more days while union committees decide if they will bless the deal. Then workers will have to vote on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deal shows that the union, with less than one-third of the 1.5 million members it had at its peak in 1979, still has a lot of clout with GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think economically the UAW will do just fine in this agreement,\" said Art Schwartz, a former GM negotiator who now is a labor consultant in Michigan. \"The union certainly still has power in this industry.\"\n",

      "President Donald Trump called UAW President Gary Jones on Wednesday night, but union spokesman Brian Rothenberg said he did not know what the men discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strike immediately brought GM's U.S. factories to a halt, and within a week, started to hamper production in Mexico and Canada. Analysts at KeyBanc investment services estimated the stoppage cut GM vehicle production by 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles. That's too much for the company to make up with overtime or increased assembly line speeds. Analysts say the costs to GM will hit around $2 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workers, on the other hand, lost north of $3,000 each on average, the difference between their base wages and $250 per week in strike pay from the union.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's nice to see there's a deal, but without knowing the details I'm a little skeptical because we don't know the highlights or the lowlights,\" said worker Nick Kuhlman, who was among the strikers huddled around a burn barrel on a blustery, gray Toledo afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just hope it gets done,\" said Toledo worker Mark Nichols, who thought the strike would last only a week or two and was ready to get back to work because his savings are running low.\n",
      "\n",
      "GM apparently was able to close three of four factories that it wanted to shutter to get rid of excess capacity in slow-selling cars and components. The Detroit-Hamtramck plant will get a new electric pickup truck and stay open, but factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore are to be closed. The Lordstown area will get an electric vehicle battery factory, but it won't have nearly as many workers as the assembly plant that for years made compact GM cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deal now will be used as a template for talks with GM's crosstown rivals, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Normally the major provisions carry over to the other two companies and cover about 140,000 auto workers nationwide. It wasn't clear which company the union would bargain with next, or whether there would be another strike.\n",

      "Schwartz said depending on the contents, the GM contract could influence wages and benefits in other industries. But he said foreign automakers with U.S. factories, mainly in the South, will give modest pay raises regardless of the GM contract, and shouldn't be affected much.\n",

      "Trinity said he can't figure out why it took 31 days for the strike to end. \"I don't understand what General Motors was expecting to get out of us. Maybe they didn't expect us to strike. Maybe they didn't expect us to strike this long.\"\n",

      "GM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry. Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other carmakers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.\n",

A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America's trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid that uncertainty, GM workers have wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly. They argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health — earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter — they wanted a bigger share.\n",
      "\n",
      "The union's bargainers have voted to recommend the deal to the UAW International Executive Board, which will vote on the agreement. Union leaders from factories nationwide will travel to Detroit for a vote on Thursday. The earliest workers could return would be after that.\n",

      "The strike had shut down 33 GM manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S., and also took down factories in Canada and Mexico. It was the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007, and the longest since a 54-day strike in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 that also halted most of GM's production.\n",

You might quiz young children in your life to determine what they know. You could scan their social studies texts to see how liberty is described. Ultimately, you will probably decide you should instruct them about liberty yourself. But how?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elementary and middle school-aged children are not developmentally ready to debate the border wall, the minimum wage, or the war on drugs. Much of the discussion about liberty that engages adults would confuse or even distress young children. When it concerns liberty, what is appropriate to teach young children? How can it be explained? Can learning about liberty be engaging for five- to twelve-year-olds? As a parent and teacher, these are the questions I pondered. I created the website Kids Learn Liberty to answer them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have ever tried to teach a young child, you know that you must build on the child’s current knowledge one small step at a time. Care must be taken to avoid using words the learner does not comprehend. Since liberty is an abstract concept, children’s grasp of it is strengthened with narratives and hands-on projects. Keeping all that in mind, here is a sample of topics from Kids Learn Liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explaining that government generally uses violence to pursue its goals would be unsuitable for young children. It would encourage fear and mistrust. However, children can learn to distinguish between cooperation and coercion. Both involve people interacting. Cooperation is voluntary. Coercion involves threats or actual harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "After learning about, and hearing examples of, cooperation and coercion, children can listen to the story The Queen of the Frogs by Davide Cali, which explores the issue of rulers vs. ruled, and The Arabolies of Liberty Street, by Sam Swope, which pits the forces of sameness against the joys of individuality. Both will set the stage for thought and discussion about cooperation and coercion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make cooperation and coercion more personal, children can write examples of human interactions on index cards and sort them into their proper categories. As world events and family and personal experiences present more examples, these can be added to the deck. When they are ready, children can learn—or better still, figure out for themselves—that most government activities are coercive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dangers and difficulties of their journeys show the importance of freedom to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immigration is an appropriate and interesting topic for five- to twelve-year-olds. Most immigrants move from less free to more free locations, which demonstrates liberty’s widespread appeal. Kids first need to know what immigration means and that troubles like war, oppression, and poverty are the reasons people relocate.

      "Though the mathematics of economic freedom would lull young children to sleep (not a bad thing if you are an exhausted parent), adults can help generate kids’ interest in the economic activity happening around them. Farmers are plowing in their fields. Construction workers are putting up new buildings. Consider taking the children in your life on a tour of a local factory. The tag inside a new pair of sneakers will tell where they were produced. Why not help their new owner find that place on a world map? Trains and delivery vehicles are loaded with products heading to customers. What are they carrying? Where might they be going? Something as commonplace as a grocery store produce department abounds with interesting examples of exchange. Tomatoes from local farms, apples from Washington state, and grapes from Chile are all products of trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "A surprising number of children’s books have economic freedom as a theme. Some are explicit, such as the classic story “I, Pencil” by Leonard Read. It cleverly describes how, without central direction, many specialists from all over the world work together to produce an everyday object. One Hen by Kate Smith Milway explains how entrepreneurship helped an African community become more prosperous.\n",
      "\n",
      "A powerful way to demonstrate the importance of liberty is to contrast free and unfree countries. Unfortunately, most nonfiction books for young children about nations such as North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela fail to explain the oppression and privation suffered by their citizens. Stories about developing nations focus on the ways that children all over the world are alike. Though this is good for nurturing understanding, getting children from wealthy countries to make the connection between liberty and lifestyle will probably require explanation. The story The Water Princess by Susan Verde describes a young African girl’s daily walks to obtain water for drinking and washing. Children with indoor plumbing will benefit from hearing that dependable tap water is a benefit of living in a free and prosperous community. Narratives are what make the realities of lack of freedom come to life. For example, truthful stories about life in North Korea (N is for North Korea by Trevor Eissler) and Afghanistan (Nasreen’s Secret School by Jeanette Winter) describe the lives of oppressed children. Hearing explanations, reading powerful narratives, and making personal connections will help young children comprehend and appreciate liberty. Then they will be better prepared for the onslaught of historic and political perspectives they will encounter in high school and beyond. The best way to preserve liberty for posterity is to make sure that those going into the future understand its importance.

      "Content Sample: Historian John Laughland explains why the International Criminal Court’s attempt to indict President Assad of Syria reveals its dictatorial and warmongering tendencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement that “a group of Syrian refugees and their London lawyers” have found “a neat legal trick” to press for an indictment against Syrian President Bashar Assad by the International Criminal Court demonstrates, yet again, the dangerous corruption of international justice, against which I have been warning for over a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Syrian war is nearly over, thanks to the military successes of the Syrian army and its Russian and Iranian allies. Exhaustion on both sides has probably helped. Diplomatic overtures have started to re-integrate Syria into the international system, starting at the regional level: the United Arab Emirates have re-opened their embassy in Damascus; the Sudanese president, Assad’s near namesake, Omar Al-Bashir, has visited Syria, as have senior Egyptian officials; Syrian officials have attended pan-Arab summits; even Israel is maintaining its dialogue with Russia over Syria. In short, the situation is being slowly normalised as Syria herself embarks on the painful search for internal peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attempt to get Assad prosecuted is an attempt to stamp out these seedlings of peace before they take root. Any prosecution against Assad would scupper, or at least severely damage, this slow acceptance that the Syrian president is part of the solution. When even the British government has accepted that Assad is here to stay, and that peace must be made with him, his implacable enemies fear that their prize is about to slip out of their grasp. They do not want peace, if that means keeping Assad.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that the goal is to sabotage any peace process because this kind of indictment is old hat in international criminal law. At the end of the Bosnian Civil War in 1995, indictments were issued against the Bosnian Serb leaders, especially Radovan Karadzic, specifically in order to remove them from the Dayton peace talks. Antonio Cassese, then president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said in 1995, just after the indictment was issued against Karadzic, that it had been issued for that reason: “The indictment means that these gentlemen will not be able to participate in peace negotiations” (quoted in the Italian daily L’Unità, 26 July 1995). Incidentally, Cassese had himself encouraged the prosecutor to bring these prosecutions even though he, as a judge and president of the tribunal, was supposed to be neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “legal trick” is designed to overcome the fact that Syria is not a state party to the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court and therefore not subject to its jurisdiction. Assad’s enemies are seeking to sidestep the fact that Syria is beyond the ICC’s reach by seeking to apply to Syria a principle which, unfortunately, the ICC itself applied to Burma last year. In September, the ICC judges agreed that a case could be brought against Myanmar (Burma), even though that country is not a state party to the Rome statute, because the crimes it had allegedly committed – deportation – had caused people to flee into Bangladesh, which is a state party. By analogy, Syria’s enemies hope that the presence of Syrian refugees in Jordan, a state party to the ICC statute, will enable them to go after Assad. They seem not to care that this is the first time anyone has ever mentioned “deportation” in Syria, although Damascus has been accused of all manner of other crimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ruling on Myanmar and Bangladesh illustrates everything that is wrong with international justice. Not only did the decision to apply jurisdiction to the Burmese authorities break the fundamental principles of international law, as expressed in the “treaty on treaties,” the 1969 Vienna Convention, which says that the principle of free consent is “universally recognized” and whose Article 34 says, “A treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a third state without its consent,” it also broke an even more fundamental principle by specifically claiming the right to define its own powers (referred to, in English texts, with the French and German expressions la compétence de la compétence and Kompetenz-Kompetenz). The Court described this as “a well-established principle of international law according to which any international tribunal has the power to determine the extent of its own jurisdiction.” In reality, it is no such thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, the powers of all organisations are determined by law. Even sovereign governments are restricted by national laws in their powers. The idea that an international organisation has the legal right to determine its own powers, and to extend its jurisdiction to states that have not accepted it, is about as blatant a violation of the rule of law as one can imagine. In the past, such claims were equivalent to declarations of war, because a claim like this can only be settled by force. For example, on July 23 1914, Austria demanded the right for its police to carry out investigations inside Serbia for the assassination of the Archduke Franz-Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 29. It sent an ultimatum to Belgrade to this effect, which Serbia refused. The result was the First World War, launched by Vienna in the name of the right to punish the perpetrators of that crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ICC has already discredited itself massively after the Laurent Gbagbo fiasco. Having collaborated in the politically-motivated indictment of the president of Côte d’Ivoire in 2011 – a collaboration which gave legitimacy to the French military operation to oust him, just as it gave legitimacy to the NATO attack on Libya by also indicting Colonel Gaddafi at the same time – the Court was forced to acquit Laurent Gbagbo eight years later, in January of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "By seeking to extend its lamentable rule to Syria, and thereby to disrupt a barely embryonic peace there, the ICC risks destroying its reputation even further. For the rules limiting the jurisdiction of international organisations to states which have consented to accept them are not some arcane technicality of international law. Instead, they reflect the most basic principle of politics, which is that those who wield power need to be constitutionally linked to those over whom they wield it. International organisations which are not based on such consent violate that very basic principle flagrantly, and therefore start to resemble the very dictatorships they pretend to combat.\n",

      "Content Sample: Technocrats have long since hijacked the American education system for their own agenda. What once was a system of actual education of students, has now become a system to produce nothing more than conditioned Technocrat workers. When this is understood, modern education programs like President George Bush’s education policy of “No Child Left Behind”, President Barack Obama’s program establishing Common Core Education Standards, and President Donald Trump’s Administration signing a UN agreement that states “We commit to facilitating the internationalization of education”, will become crystal clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Technocracy Study Course was written in 1934 by M. King Hubbert and Howard Scott, it was literally intended to be the “bible” of Technocracy. It contained all of the basic elements of societal construction along with rules and principles for living.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the pillar service sectors of Technocracy was education. On page 232, “The end products attained by a high-energy social mechanism on the North American Continent” are listed as:\n",
      "• an educational system to train the entire younger generation indiscriminately as regards all considerations other than inherent ability—a Continental system of human conditioning. (emphasis added)\n",
      "\n",
      "William Akin elaborated on this in his book, Technocracy and the American Dream (1978, pg. 142)\n",
      "\n",
      "A continental system of human conditioning will have to be installed to replace the existing insufficient educational methods and institutions. This continental system of general education will have to be organized as to provide the fullest possible conditioning and physical training… It must educate and train the student public so as to obtain the highest possible percentage of proficient functional capacity. Since the basic need of society was technical expertise, their education system would abolish the liberal arts, which addressed outmoded moralistic solutions to human problems. It would essentially replace the humanities with the machine shop. In the process, members of society would be conditioned to think in terms of engineering rationality and efficiency. Man, in short, would then be conditioned to assume the character of machines, to accept “a reality understood in terms of machine-like function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early Technocrats, thoroughly captivated by the vain religion of Scientism, believed that truth about man and the universe could only be discovered through science. As a result, the pioneer of behavioral psychology, B.F. Skinner, was a principal contributor to Technocrat understanding of human conditioning. It was a theory that they eagerly embraced and applied to their utopian model of Technocracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skinner’s association with the Technocracy movement has been well documented in academic literature. Alexandra Rutherford, for instance, wrote B.F. Skinner and Technology’s Nation: Technocracy, Social Engineering, and the Good Life in 20th-Century America in the History of Psychology and stated,\n",
      "\n",
      "The balance of Rutherford’s paper detailed the “several philosophical and structural similarities between the Technocrats’ and Skinner’s social visions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Technocracy Study Course is thoroughly dependent on this line of thinking, and every chapter stresses the importance of and need for “conditioning” of all members of society in order for Utopia to materialize. Of course, this goes well beyond just education, but early conditioning of young students was of paramount importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the modern drift of education toward Technocratic conditioning started in the early 1980s, it is not the purpose of this paper to present details that others have presented over the years. Rather, I will skip forward to the latest program called the Common Core Education Standards Initiative (CCESI) that has swept the American education system over the last 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "CCESI was sponsored by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), both of which are non-governmental organizations. CCSSO is a progressive advocacy organization that focuses on “education workforce; information systems and research; next generation learners; and standards, assessment, and accountability.” The NGA’s membership is exclusively the Governors of each state and territory, but it presents itself as a political organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that both the NGA and CCSSO are completely independent of any government authority or accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did funding for CCESI come from the federal government? No! Instead, the primary financier was the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that is controlled by Microsoft pioneer Bill Gates – a Technocrat. In fact, over a 10-year period, Gates provided almost $500 million to various organizations to develop the curriculum according to his own personal vision of education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, according to its own website, the resulting copyright for CCESI is tightly held by these same organizations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Parents today wonder why the nature and focus of education has changed so radically over the last 10 years. The simple reason is that it has been hijacked by private Technocrat-oriented organizations and funded by Technocrats like Bill Gates. To call this a monumental coup would be an understatement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, they had help and cooperation from the federal government to distribute it to the individual states, but that only demonstrates how deep the Technocrat influence runs within our political structures.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pioneered in highly complex environments, such as aviation and nuclear energy, HROs put procedures and protocols in place that maximize safety and minimize harm, which in the medical industry assures every patient receives excellent care, every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“VA has been a leader in patient safety for years,” said VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. “Adopting high reliability principles more formally represents the next step for delivering the best health care to Veterans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These principles align with our greater vision of transforming business operations and delivering exceptional customer service to Veterans,” Wilkie said. “Our culture is changing and pursuing HRO principles nationwide is our pledge to empower staff and keep Veterans the safest they can be on our watch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Research shows high reliability organizations experience fewer accidents despite being high-risk environments where small errors can produce catastrophic results. A February Leadership Summit kicked off the HRO journey and introduced high reliability concepts and practices to the 18 sites. Lessons learned from these 18 sites will guide a more impactful rollout across every Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical facility in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 18 sites selected are: Manchester VA Medical Center (VAMC) (N.H.); Albany Samuel S. Stratton VAMC (N.Y.); Erie VAMC (Pa.); Beckley VAMC (W.Va.); Durham VAMC (N.C.); Ralph H. Johnson VAMC (Charleston, S.C.); James A. Haley Veterans Hospital (Tampa, Fla.); James H. Quillen VA Healthcare System (HCS) (Johnson City, Tenn.); Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC (Ohio); William S.

      "In addition to a safer environment focused on reducing errors and preventing patient harm, HRO principles and values call for deference to expertise; oftentimes, the patient’s family caregiver is that expert.

      "\n",
      "Diet is already a key part of managing diseases like diabetes and hypertension, but new research adds to a growing body of evidence that it could help cancer treatment too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, found restricting intake of an amino acid found in red meat and eggs significantly enhanced cancer treatment in mice, slowing tumour growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are very strong effects, and they are effects that are as strong as we would see with drugs that work,\" said lead researcher Jason Locasale, an associate professor at Duke University's School of Medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What this study is showing is that there are many situations where a drug by itself doesn't work, but if you combine the drug with the diet, it works, or the radiation therapy doesn't work well, but if you combine... with the diet, it works well,\" he told AFP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study focused on restricting intake of the amino acid methionine which is key to a process called one-carbon metabolism that helps cancer cells grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methionine restriction has already been associated with both anti-aging and weight loss, but its importance to cancerous cells suggested it could also be a promising way to enhance cancer treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers first tested methionine restriction in healthy mice to confirm it was having the desired effects on metabolism and then moved to testing it in mice with colorectal cancer and soft tissue sarcomas.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found that a low dose of chemotherapy, which on its own had no effect on colorectal cancer, led to \"marked inhibition of tumour growth\" when combined with methionine restriction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, combining methionine restriction with radiation therapy in the case of the soft tissue sarcoma reduced tumour growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're starving the cancer cells of certain nutrients, at a very basic level,\" explained Locasale.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cautioned that the results should not be extrapolated beyond the cancers tested so far, and that the research was far from being tested in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is certainly not a be-all, end-all to cancer, this is not some panacea,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What it's showing is that there are very interesting interactions between the food we eat, how it changes metabolism... and then how those changes in cellular metabolism might have an effect on tumour growth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Independent experts also warned against reading too much into the study just yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before drawing any conclusions about the potential for dietary restriction as an approach to treating cancer, human studies are needed,\" said Paul Pharoah, a professor of Cancer Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Locasale and his colleagues extended the research by testing a methionine restricted diet in six healthy humans, and found that the effect on human metabolism appeared similar to that seen in mice.\n",
      "\n",
      "That suggests that the diet could have a similar effect on certain tumours in humans, though Locasale warned it was far too early to draw any definitive conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, warned that \"there is no evidence from this study to suggest following a vegan diet with help patients with cancer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Locasale said he hoped to eventually test the research in humans with cancer, but noted that nutrition research often struggles for funding because it proposes treatments that are not easily monetizable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, he said the work adds to a body of research that suggests diet may play an important role in cancer treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, a study showed one type of chemotherapy drug was more effective in combination with a diet low in sugar and high in protein and fat. Other cancers appear to be better combatted in combination with low-sugar diets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just a really exciting area right now... where we're seeing that diet has a huge effect on human health,\" Locasale said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hopes for a future where doctors will eventually be able to advise cancer patients to follow specific diets to assist their treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not there yet, but the goal is to eventually get there.\"\n",

This year’s Cenotaph-adjacent vein-busters were basically the same as the previous years: “Fury as Jeremy Corbyn fails to shave his head and paint ‘LEST WE FORGET’ across his skull in poppy-red face paint” – and I, for one, am calling for fresh story lines. Nearby, Boris Johnson looked, frankly, as if he’d left my house at 10am in an Uber with a can of Dark Fruit for the road “to perk one up”. He looked like I’d been begging him to get two hours sleep – mate, please, you can use my bed, honestly – but he insists on playing The xx remixes off YouTube instead. Keeps asking me how the PlayStation controller works and whether it is possible to close any more curtains. His phone’s on 1% because he keeps Googling what time the shops open. That sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only… oh? The footage of the wreath-laying on BBC Breakfast on Monday morning showed a markedly fresher-faced Johnson, laying a different coloured wreath, the right way up this time, and looking, well, as if he didn’t have an entry-stamp to The Dolphin on his inner wrist and £60 in notes in his wallet just in case. Eagle-eyed viewers immediately noticed the discrepancy, and the BBC issued a short mea culpa: the line they stuck to was that footage of the 2016 wreath-laying, prepared for a preview of the 2019 wreath laying, was accidentally used instead of footage of the 2019 ceremony. And because it’s 2019 we all accepted the apology and moved on. Ah, sorry, my mistake, no: because it’s 2019 we’re still talking about it days later and will continue to for many days and possibly years to come.\n",

      "Are there lessons from what history will refer to as #Wreathgate?

Very hard to tell.\n",

On a third hand, which is a thing: Rob Burley, the editor for BBC live political programmes and unlikely star of this election so far, came out and tweeted a Big And Bruising denial (“wave upon wave of insulting, self-righteous and hysterical tweets keep on coming because people really want it to be true”), which perversely makes me believe the conspiracy more. I don’t know what to do.\n",

Do you know how many high-functioning online entire subreddits dedicated to this there are? Do you know how on edge we all are after the whole Epstein thing? In 2016, American conspiracy heads got carried away and fired a rifle in a pizza parlour because it didn’t have a big enough basement. We’re not in the mood for this any more. You can’t go round splicing respectful footage into other respectful footage and thinking you can get away with it. Do better, BBC. Do better.\n",

There’s always something intriguing about watching politicians trying to act like people under the laser-hot glare of the media – we all remember how spectacularly Ed Miliband messed up eating a sandwich just because someone was watching him – but the man cleans like he’s only been introduced to the sheer concept of mopping in a short brief on the car ride over (“It’s a series of strings on the end of a stick, Boris, commonly used on the wetter end of domestic messes”). Would be very up for a series of videos of him just doing things over the next five weeks. Scratching his head over the recycling schedule. Logging into Netflix using only a TV remote. Changing the timer on his oven after the clocks go back. Sky News, hit me up for more.\n",

The strict 10.30am cut-off that currently exists works on two levels: it gets hungover people out of bed with some sort of deadline to work to, and it means cooks don’t have to keep a fried egg warm all day in an over-capacity kitchen. If you want an Egg McMuffin, wake up and get it. Anything beyond that is anti-worker, frankly. This should be a far bigger furore than it is.\n",

      "\n",
      "The reason behind this? Palm oil’s ‘harmful environmental impact,' which is having a devastating impact on wildlife and tropical forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the production, uses and dangers of palm oil:\n",

      "A type of vegetable oil that is made from the fruit of oil palm trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the most commonly used vegetable oil with around 66 million tonnes produced each year – and it’s found in around half of all supermarket products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr Emma Keller from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) told BBC Newsround: \"Palm oil is a super-efficient crop, meaning that we can produce a lot more palm oil per area of land compared to other oil crops like soybean oil or coconut oil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Palm oil production has also provided jobs for “millions of small farmers”, helping them to get out of poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past century, the demand for palm oil has risen dramatically which means large areas of tropical forest in south-east Asia and Africa have been destroyed as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 1990 and 2008 palm oil production was responsible for 8 per cent of the world’s deforestation as forests are burnt to clear areas for people to grow oil palms – which, in some cases, is illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burning these forests means destroying the habitats for wildlife and plants in the area, with elephants, orangutans, tigers and rhinos among the animals affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, around 100,000 orangutans were lost between 1999 and 2015 due to palm oil production, other animals are being pushed to extinction and indigenous people are losing their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, destruction of rainforests contributes to rising greenhouse gas emissions which contributes to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many everyday products contain palm oil including lipstick, shampoo, detergent, chocolate, biscuits, soap, ice cream and pizza dough – so it's difficult to avoid it completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution? Try to choose palm oil free products where you can to cut down your consumption. The lower the demand for palm oil based products, the more likely brands will be to change their policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "More efforts need to be made to monitor palm oil and make sure it's produced sustainably, without harming animals and forests during the process.\n",

The bats have been handcrafted in Brazil from layers of wood off-cuts before being coated in a hard-wearing resin to protect them from sand and sea water.

      "Content Sample: Your expenses don't end when your paychecks do, but creating a reliable income stream in retirement can be tricky. The right choices can result in sustainable income for the rest of your life. The wrong choices could leave you uncomfortably short of cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, retirement includes so many important, potentially irreversible decisions that most people could benefit from a few sessions with a fee-only, fiduciary financial planner. (Fiduciary means the adviser is committed to putting your interests ahead of their own.) These ideally would start about 10 years before retirement. Understanding some key concepts could make those discussions easier — or keep you from making serious mistakes if you take a do-it-yourself approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security will make up 60% to 80% of most retirees’ income, so maximizing those checks is essential, says actuary Steve Vernon, a consulting research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security checks can start at age 62, but abundant research shows most people are better off delaying. Waiting until 70, when benefits max out, is typically the optimal strategy for single people and the higher wage earner in a couple, says Vernon, author of “Retirement Game-Changers.” People’s situations can vary, though, so they would be smart to consult Social Security calculators to help them decide when to start. AARP’s site has a free one, or search for more sophisticated versions from Maximize My Social Security ($40 and up) and Social Security Solutions ($20 and up).\n",
      "\n",
      "A planner might recommend tapping retirement accounts or working just enough to substitute for the income you would otherwise receive from Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, fixed expenses in retirement would be covered by guaranteed income, such as Social Security and pensions, so that your basic lifestyle isn’t jeopardized by stock market fluctuations. If those sources aren’t enough to cover basic costs, an income annuity could help fill the gap, says certified financial analyst Wade Pfau, author of “Safety-First Retirement Planning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Income annuities are insurance products that can offer a lifetime stream of monthly payments in exchange for a lump sum. Unlike variable annuities or other investments, the amount you get doesn’t vary if the stock market goes up or down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another option could be a reverse mortgage, a loan that can convert some of your home equity into a stream of monthly checks. If you have a lot of equity but still have a mortgage, a reverse mortgage could pay off your loan and eliminate those monthly payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial planners’ “4% rule” suggests withdrawing 4% of your portfolio the first year, adjusting the amount each year afterward for inflation. This strategy historically has posed a low risk of running out of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some planners, however, worry that 4% may be too high given current low interest rates and high stock valuations. The “Spend Safely in Retirement” method, which Vernon created with the help of the Society of Actuaries, recommends using annual withdrawal rates based on the IRS’ required minimum distribution rules. The percentage rises slightly each year according to age. A 60-year-old might withdraw 2.72%, a 65-year-old would tap 3.13% and a 70-year-old would take 3.65%. The withdrawal would be made at the end of each year, then the money is moved into a savings account or other investment that protects the principal, so it’s available to spend the following year without risk of market losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the 4% rule, the “Spend Safely in Retirement” approach poses no risk of running out of money but can result in income that varies considerably from year to year. Retirees who have their basic expenses covered by guaranteed income might look at their portfolio income as a bonus, Vernon says. A bigger one can pay for splurges, while a smaller bonus might require cutting discretionary spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many retirees are tempted to move their money into “safe” investments such as bonds, certificates of deposit or savings accounts. Unfortunately, those investments may not keep up with inflation over time. Devoting at least 50% of investment portfolios to stocks — ideally using a low-cost target date, balanced or stock index fund — can produce more income over time, Vernon says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you create a retirement paycheck, your work isn’t done. You’ll still need emergency funds for unexpected expenses and a strategy to pay for long-term care, among other tasks. But establishing a reliable income stream can help you meet your regular expenses in retirement without worrying you’ll run out of cash.\n",

      "Content Sample: President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn't have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Though we don't have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it's not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,\" he said. \"Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a \"calculated political move\" by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been different, Anderson said, if Trump had signed a Bible out of the limelight for someone with whom he had a close connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For me, the Bible is a very important part of my faith, and I don't think it should be used as a political ploy,\" she said. \"I saw it being used just as something out there to symbolize his support for the evangelical community, and it shouldn't be used in that way. People should have more respect for Scripture.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "York said that he, personally, would not ask a politician to sign a Bible, but that he has been asked to sign Bibles after he preaches. It feels awkward, he said, but he doesn't refuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it's meaningful to them to have signatures in their Bible, I'm willing to do that,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A request for comment was left with the White House on Saturday, a day after Trump visited Alabama to survey the devastation and pay respects to tornado victims. The tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide, killing 23 people, including four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Providence Baptist Church in the Beauregard community in Alabama, the Rev. Rusty Sowell said, the president's visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before leaving the church, Trump posed for a photograph with a fifth-grade volunteer and signed the child's Bible, said Ada Ingram, a local volunteer. The president also signed her sister's Bible, Ingram said. In photos from the visit, Trump is shown signing the cover of a Bible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump should have at least signed inside in a less ostentatious way, said the Rev. Dr. Kevin Cassiday-Maloney.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It just felt like hubris,\" said Cassiday-Maloney, pastor at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Fargo, North Dakota. \"It almost felt like a desecration of the holy book to put his signature on the front writ large, literally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He doesn't think politicians should sign Bibles, he said, because it could be seen as a blurring of church and state and an endorsement of Christianity over other religions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been out of line if Trump had brought Bibles and given them out, but that wasn't the case, said James Coffin, executive director of the Interfaith Council of Central Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too much is being made out of something that doesn't deserve that kind of attention,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill Leonard, the founding dean and professor of divinity emeritus at the Wake Forest University School of Divinity in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, woke up to Facebook posts Saturday morning by former students who were upset about Trump signing the Bibles because they don't view him as an appropriate example of spiritual guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Leonard said, it's important to remember that signing Bibles is an old tradition, particularly in Southern churches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leonard said he would have viewed it as more problematic if the signings were done at a political rally. He doesn't see how Trump could have refused at the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would've been worse if he had said no because it would've seemed unkind, and this was at least one way he could show his concern along with his visit,\" he said. \"In this setting, where tragedy has occurred and where he comes for this brief visit, we need to have some grace about that for these folks.\"\n",

      "For healthcare professionals, especially those who were not born before the 1960s, it is my opinion you have a learning curve to undertake, since you have been taught in med school how to castrate the innate immune system Nature provides, and substitute it with Big Pharma’s reprogramming body chemistry to make the humoral system the body’s prime immune system, which, quite frankly, is “ass backwards.”\n",

      "Content Sample: The ongoing government shutdown is about to turn into the longest one in U.S. history and that's raising questions about what will happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Friday, many of the 800,000 federal workers affected are expected to have missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began three weeks ago. And by Saturday, the funding lapse will be the longest in history at 22 days, surpassing the 21-day holiday shutdown that stretched into 1996.\n",
      "\n",
      "The missing paychecks are likely to trigger at least some unemployment claims with states, as well as possible resignations by federal workers who have grown tired of the instability. That could include airline security personnel, prison guards, food inspectors, Coast Guard personnel and border patrol officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already, an estimated 4,500 people have filed for unemployment in the nation's capital. Airline workers are showing up on Capitol Hill urging Congress to reach a deal, and a separate major union rally is planned for Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, most agencies say there haven't been any major disruptions to government operations because workers deemed essential -- about 420,000 -- have been ordered to keep working despite not being paid. At least two lawsuits have been filed on their behalf, with major unions arguing that requiring work without pay isn't fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as one agency official put it, if the shutdown extends past February, \"we'll be digging into the couch cushions\" to keep the most important operations afloat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a look at the latest shutdown developments and what could happen next:\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington's city government estimates that about 4,500 people -– 3,745 federal workers and 822 federal contractors -- already have filed for unemployment as a direct result of the shutdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's likely just the beginning. Federal workers can file for unemployment benefits where they worked, and, according to one major union, some 85 percent of the federal workforce exists outside Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rules vary from state to state. But it's generally expected that employees would have to repay any unemployment benefits if they receive back pay once the shutdown ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one small comfort for federal workers though: The Office of Personnel and Management on Wednesday said that employees required to work during the shutdown will be able to reschedule any paid time off they may have lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food stamp recipients will have access to their full benefits for February, even if the partial government shutdown continues, the Agriculture Department told reporters late Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The department said it will work with states to load benefits onto recipients' cards by Jan. 20, just within the deadline for a provision that allows them to pay out benefits, even without a budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still a concern are expiring contracts for a program by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that subsidizes rent and utilities for 1.2 million low-income families. HUD announced that some 1,150 contracts with private landlords have expired since the shutdown, with another 500 set to expire later this month and 500 more next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agency sent the landlords letters earlier this month urging them to dip into any reserves, and an agency spokesman said he didn't expect any evictions to take place because landlords know they will eventually get paid when the shutdown ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There have never been evictions of any kind because of government shutdowns,\" HUD spokesman Brian Sullivan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worth noting though is that if the shutdown stretches into February, which is possible considering the lack of progress in budget talks, HUD and other agencies would be working in uncharted territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The local water provider in Washington said the federal government is short $5 million of the $16.5 million it owes, according to a recent letter it received from the Treasury Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matthew Brown, chief financial officer at the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, known as D.C. Water, said they usually don't charge late fees to customers like the federal government and the delayed payments won't immediately hurt the water authority's pocket books.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would probably be, just off the top of my head, approximately a year before it begins to be a real problem,\" Brown said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also a concern are the air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration. This week, nearly 100 air traffic controllers went to Capitol Hill to call for an end to the shutdown. An association of the workers said they're already at a 30-year staffing low nationwide. They expect their first missing paycheck around Jan. 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the shutdown, routine domestic food inspections were suspended by the Food and Drug Administration, although foreign food inspections continued along with what the agency called surveillance of \"high-risk\" foods and facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food and Drug Administrator Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Wednesday that the agency is \"taking steps\" to expand domestic food safety inspections further during the shutdown, focusing on high-risk facilities that make up a third of regular inspections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gottlieb tweeted that he wants to bring food inspectors back to work as early as next week, though they still would not be paid until the government reopens.\n",

      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is calling back employees to staff 38 national wildlife refuges across the country under a temporary 30-day plan that will rely on leftover money from its 2018 budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to the National Park Services, refuges were accessible to the public, minus the staff or access to visitors centers. The workers that come back will be carrying out prescribed burns to manage the areas and minimize wildfire risk. They will also staff visitors centers and conduct maintenance, as well as continue working on environmental rules they hope to complete before next fall's hunting season.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, the biggest visible impact of the shutdown for the general public has been at the national parks, where the absence of staff has meant a pileup of trash and safety violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the parks have said they are working to restore basic services including trash pick up using money previously collected from entrance fees and campground fees. One site, Joshua Tree National Park in California, had announced it planned to close temporarily Thursday to deal with sanitation and safety issues. But it later said it was able to avert that shutdown using recreation fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parks though will still take a financial hit even when the shutdown ends. Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee have estimated that NPS could lose $400,000 a day in fees if there isn't staff available to collect from visitors. Also, parks may have to pay to repair damage done by visitors not following park rules during the shutdown.\n",

      "Content Sample: This month of June, the National Security Advisors of Russia, the US, and Israel, Nikolay Patrushev, John Bolton and Meir Ben-Shabbat, respectively, are expected to meet in Jerusalem to talk about Iran and Syria and what Israel considers the “threat to its security” in the Levant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well-informed sources believe the meeting will bring nothing new, mainly due to continued Israeli violations of Syrian sovereignty and its bombing of Iranian targets far from the borders. Israel cannot expect any support from Russia in this regard, and this is why. The Kremlin’s hands are tied, and it is unwilling to take a stand against the wishes of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this meeting is significant only because it has no precedent and is a concession to a request by Netanyahu to President Vladimir Putin last February during the Israeli Prime Minister’s visit to the Kremlin. Also, it shows US compliance with Netanyahu’s request to President Donald Trump during the visit to the White House last March.\n",
      "\n",
      "High-ranking sources among decision-makers say this: “Netanyahu runs to his allies to cry on their shoulders when he is the aggressor, as in every single problem in the Levant, particularly when the Israeli military exceeds the limits and crosses red lines. Last year, Russia agreed with Iran to create a kind of safety perimeter for the Russian military to take control along the Quneitra-Golan Heights front. That would have made it possible to ease the situation on the borders and allow President Assad and his allies to concentrate on other fronts. Iran responded positively to the Russian request, following the approval of President Assad”.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is important to point out that Russia is not part of and doesn’t adopt the objectives of the “Axis of the Resistance”. It has excellent relations with Israel, Iran and Hezbollah, and considers Syria a strategic ally. Moscow tries to keep a balance in its relations with the countries of the Middle East. Nevertheless, Russia has rushed to support the integrity of Syria, its government and army. It has acted as a second Syrian Air Force, bombing all Syria’s enemies and helping the Syrian government recover the control of its territory. Of course, the situation in the north-east under US occupation and the north-west under al-Qaeda-like groups and pro-Turkish militants is more complicated and confusing. The destiny of these two areas is connected and mature political and diplomatic efforts at coordination will be necessary before moving towards a military option to liberate the north”, said the decision-maker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concernant the Iranian deployment in Syria, the source said: “Israel took advantage of Russian efforts and bombed Iranian positions in the heart of Syria and on the coast. These positions are valuable and linked to the organisation of the Syrian army’s strategic armaments (missile production industrial objectives and strategic military warehouses). Thus, it was Israel’s choice to change the Rule of Engagement (ROE), triggering the return of Syrian allies, i.e. Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), to the borders with the occupied Golan Heights annexed by Israel. Russia found itself in no position to intervene and prevent their return because it was Israel which dismantled what Russia had tried to achieve on these borders”.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to why Syria and its allies did not respond to Israel’s aggressive violations of Syrian sovereignty and its bombing of hundreds of objectives in Syria, the source answered: “Iran’s National Security responsible Admiral Ali Shamkhani has said his country and President Assad will respond by bombing objectives (in Israel) if the Israeli Air Force bombs Syria. Nothing has happened, true. The late Secretary General of Hezbollah Sayyed Abbas al-Moussawi (assassinated by Israel in 1992) used to say that it is important to concentrate on the main objectives and avoid wasting time and energy, regardless of what Israel might do. Israel’s objective is to divert attention from Syria’s main strategic goals. Today Hezbollah and the IRGC have returned to the borders and Russia is no longer in a position to ask for another withdrawal. The destiny and the front of the Shebaa Farms (a Lebanese area occupied by Israel) and the Golan Heights are intertwined, and Syria and its allies are actively working on these objectives”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today in Syria there are priorities which take precedence over a battle with Israel. Fighting Israel is not an option for the Syrian President even if several high-value targets have been destroyed. Israel is conscious of the situation and feels disoriented and angry even though it is aware that Syria and its allies are not willing to open a wide military front during this critical period in the Middle East. What is also highly probable is that Israel cannot expect Hezbollah and Iran to remain silent for very long.\n",
      "\n",
      "To any ordinary observer, it looks like Israel is mocking the Syrian leadership and its allies, enjoying an unstoppable free ride in Syria with no accountability for its actions. Nevertheless, it is President Assad who believes there is no compelling reason for Syria and its allies to bomb Israel. Idlib has priority, as does the reconstruction of Syria and the delivery of fundamental necessities to its inhabitants (energy, schooling, rebuilding societies and cities). The war with Israel can wait and is going nowhere, President Assad believes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia is not in a position to offer Israel what it needs, simply because Netanyahu is unreliable. Netanyahu had his opportunity and has decided to throw it out of the window, prioritising the bombing of Iranian objectives in the country. This may well reduce the Russian-American-Israeli meeting to a picture-taking opportunity. The Israeli Prime Minister will have the opportunity to take credit for staging an unprecedented meeting and will temporarily benefit from this propaganda. However, he will definitely come away empty handed.\n",

      "Content Sample: Staunton, December 1 – A conflict between the Russian Orthodox Church and the traditional faith of the North Ossetians has broken out with renewed vigor as the republic prepares to mark the 1100th anniversary of the founding of the Alania state, a state so important to Ossetian thought that in 1993, nationalists insisted Alania be named to the republic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alania, a medieval kingdom in the North Caucasus roughly coterminous with Circassia and North Ossetia that had its capital in Magas, which is now in Ingushetia, was not Christian but followed a traditional animist faith. Support for that faith remains high, but talking about it undermines the borders in the region and Moscow’s efforts to rope in South Ossetia.\n",
      "\n",
      "(The best explication of this complicated and still sensitive history is provided by Victor Shnirelman in his 2007 article, “The Politics of a Name: Between Consolidation and Separation in the Northern Caucasus,” Acta Slavica Iaponica . It is available online at\n",
      "\n",
      "The archbishop’s comments were then attacked by several commentators, and then 300 believers from the region published an open letter to Patriarch Kirill in which they said that they no longer recognized” the archbishop as their spiritual leader because of his attacks on the Ossetian nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roman Lunkin, a specialist on religious affairs at the Moscow Institute for Europe, says that this is hardly the first time that such a conflict has broken out, but that it is serious both for the republic and for Moscow. In North Ossetia-Alania, many followers of the traditional faith remain angry that the Orthodox have taken over their religious sites without acknowledgement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The presence of Orthodox icons in holy places and groves is something the pagans consider a sacrilege,” the religious specialist says. And support for their position is far greater than for traditional religions in Mari El or Sakha, although pagans in those republics have received more attention in the recent past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The civil authorities in North Ossetia-Alania have not been able to smooth this over, Lunkin adds; but they must make an effort because the clash between the Orthodox and the followers of the traditional faith creates serious problems for “the nationality policy of the center in the regions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only does it threaten to exacerbate tensions concerning borders in the North Caucasus by elevating the idea that North Ossetia-Alania has justified claims to far more territory than is now within its borders, but it also complicates Moscow’s task in dealing with South Ossetia, the republic that broke away from Georgia with Russian help in 2008.\n",

Should Trump somehow manage to win you could see major Brexit-style selling.”\n",

      "The new report suggests that the stock market is worth 11 percent more under a Clinton presidency than a Trump presidency. This is a highly unusual circumstance because markets historically prefer Republican policies on taxes, regulation and trade to those of Democrats.\n",

      "“At this point, even though the odds are so high that it’s all but certain Clinton wins, it’s best to hedge right now,” said Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. “Maybe look at some short options or look at dollar-Mexican peso longs to hedge off the risk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This also suggests that a shock Trump victory next month could crush stock prices, perhaps by as much as 10 percent, and send the peso and other currencies sharply lower while ushering in a period of intense market volatility as investors try and discern how Trump would govern and whether he would make good on his pledge to start trade wars with Mexico and China and deport 11 million current undocumented immigrants.\n",

      "Overall, the authors of the new paper envision a massive global market shock should Trump win. “Given the magnitude of the price movements, we estimate that market participants believe that a Trump victory would reduce the value of the S&P 500, the UK, and Asian stock markets by 10-15%,” they write and “would reduce the oil price by $4, would lead to a 25% decline in the Mexican Peso, and would significantly increase expected future stock market volatility.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There remains one bright spot for Wall Street should Trump shock the world. In the immediate aftermath, investors could bet on high volatility in stocks and a sharp rise in gold and other safe havens. And then they could bet on a recovery as occurred in the weeks following the Brexit vote.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are many unanswered questions surrounding the circumstances of the woman's death in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has not previously been reported.\n",
      "• On the front line of the Ebola epidemic\n",
      "\n",
      "But it has raised concerns because the woman, whose name has not been released for confidentiality reasons, was thought to have had immunity after surviving infection, but fell ill again with Ebola and died.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was a big red flag event for all of us,\" said Janet Diaz, who leads WHO's clinical management team for the epidemic in the DRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "DRC's Ebola outbreak has infected over 3,000 people and killed more than 2,000 since August last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the second-worst outbreak after one in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 that killed more than 11,000 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman was working as a caregiver in the high-risk \"red zone\" of a treatment centre in Beni, eastern DRC, according to health officials familiar with her case.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was one of dozens of people assigned to care for Ebola patients because it was assumed they would not get sick as Ebola survivors, although some researchers have considered reinfection to be at least a theoretical possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their presumed immunity allowed for closer contact with sufferers, many of them children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alima, the medical charity that co-ran the Beni centre where she worked, said she tested positive for Ebola and died in July before she could be readmitted for treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is not yet known whether the woman received a false positive result the first time she was tested, experienced a relapse or was reinfected, health officials say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medical experts say it could be years before Ebola survivors' immunity is fully understood. Yet the recent case is sufficiently worrying for health authorities to rethink how care should be provided to Ebola patients across eastern DRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO and Congolese officials have drafted new guidelines, seen by Reuters News Agency, that warn that some Ebola survivors may have \"incomplete immunity\" and advise that additional measures should be taken to protect them from possible reinfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new protocols would set limits on which Ebola survivors can work in treatment centres and standardise precautions that must be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Survivors who had mild cases of Ebola and those who were found to have low viral loads - or lower levels of the virus circulating in their blood - while infected \"need to be carefully assessed, as they may be at risk for having incomplete immunity after infection,\" the draft says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diaz said the protocols were still being discussed with health organisations and could change in the drafting process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to contain the DRC outbreak have been hampered by insecurity and public mistrust, but aided by medical advances including new vaccines and therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ebola survivors, known as \"les vainqueurs\" - French for \"the victorious\" - have been at the forefront of treatment, offering vital care, especially to children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their assumed immunity has meant they could spend extended time with patients and provide much-needed human contact. The protective gear they must wear is lighter and less restrictive than that worn by other health workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the draft protocols being discussed by health authorities would bar some survivors from working in the contaminated red zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "These include people whose immune systems may be weaker because they are pregnant or because they have other infections such as HIV or tuberculosis, and those who had low viral loads during their Ebola infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman who died was pregnant at the time, which she had not disclosed to the treatment centre, according to Nicolas Mouly, Alima's emergencies coordinator. But it is not known if that played a role in her falling sick again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouly said the DRC's biomedical research institute was running tests to learn more about the case. Officials with the DRC's Ebola response and the institute did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the case, health authorities have reviewed the clinical histories of all Ebola survivors working with Ebola patients, WHO's Diaz said. They have also reminded treatment centres to ensure their employees are following biosafety rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much remains unknown about how immunity works in Ebola survivors, including how treatments might affect a patient's susceptibility to reinfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think that's the big question: What is the true immunity of an Ebola patient who survived?\" Diaz said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everyone's working very hard right now to both care for patients and also move science along.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been several confirmed cases of relapse with Ebola, including a Scottish nurse who was infected in Sierra Leone in 2014 and fell ill again 10 months after recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the symptoms have tended to be localised in certain parts of the body and are not known to have been fatal, according to Raina MacIntyre, who heads the Biosecurity Program at the University of New South Wales' Kirby Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "No case of reinfection has been confirmed since the disease was discovered near the Ebola River in northern Congo in 1976.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short-term immunity has largely been treated as a given. And a study of 14 survivors of the first documented Ebola outbreak in 1976 found that all were able to develop an immune reaction to at least one of three Ebola virus proteins 40 years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alima's Mouly said the creation of a standardised set of rules for survivors working in treatment centres was a positive step, but recommended further measures to ensure the physical and mental wellbeing of all survivors.\n",

      "Content Sample: People participate in a protest on the second day of oral arguments for the Affordable Care Act in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, DC, March 27, 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "WASHINGTON — A lawsuit winding through the courts could overturn Obamacare and cause millions of people to lose their health insurance, but Senate Republicans say there is nothing to worry about because Congress will come to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "In interviews with over a dozen Republican senators, most said they believed Congress is up to the task of passing a new health bill if the Affordable Care Act is overturned by the Supreme Court, though there exists no evidence to date that Congress is actually up to the task. Several said the ACA getting struck down would be a good thing because it would force Congress to come to an agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be noisy and loud, but it would need to be done. Congress only seems to get things done when they have to, so this would be one of those ‘have to’ ones,” said Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a scenario that has grown more realistic month by month. The Trump administration and 20 Republican-led states are arguing in court that the entire Affordable Care Act should be tossed out. One federal judge has already sided with them, and earlier this month they presented arguments to what appeared to be a receptive panel of judges at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. It is widely expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court either way, setting up a possible climactic decision in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fight over Obamacare went all the way to the Supreme Court in 2012, and some provisions were struck down. But in a landmark 5–4 ruling, with Chief Justice John Roberts serving as the swing vote, the court upheld the law’s individual mandate. The new lawsuit is even broader with Republican lawyers pushing for every bit of the 900-page law to be tossed out now that Congress has repealed the individual mandate, arguing that without it the rest of the law is unconstitutional without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The GOP argument is that Obamacare disappearing would be so catastrophic — regulated markets would collapse, millions of low-income people would lose Medicaid, insurers could once again deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions — that Congress would have no choice but to set aside their differences and pass a replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One thing I’ve learned in eight and a half years here is you need almost a crisis to concentrate the minds and actually accomplish something, so hopefully we’d be able to do that,” said Sen. Ron Johnson.\n",
      "\n",
      "There would be obstacles. Congress would have to reach a deal that Senate Republicans, President Trump, and House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi could all agree on. The two parties are pushing in wildly opposite directions on health care, and this crisis could be dropped on them during the throes of a presidential election. There has been no movement since Trump took office to fix even smaller parts of the ACA. Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray spent months negotiating a bipartisan bill to stabilize Obamacare markets and lower premiums. It has yet to be brought up for a vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are already some plans out there that could be dusted off and people of goodwill could conceivably come together,” said Republican Sen. Todd Young. “I know it would be challenging and— Why are you giving me that look? I’m acknowledging the challenge!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked whether they could imagine a split Congress managing to pass a comprehensive new health care system in an election year, Democrats mostly expressed bewilderment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seriously? You’ve got Republican senators who actually say that with a straight face?” said Sen. Chris Coons during an interview in a cramped Senate elevator. “They had nine years to come up with a replacement plan and haven’t. I don’t find that credible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nine years!” Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said to his Republican colleagues Mike Rounds and Rob Portman, all wedged in the elevator as well. “Oh my god, do your job, would you? Son of a bitch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In theory, Democrats and Republicans agree on keeping two parts of Obamacare: protecting people with preexisting conditions and allowing children to stay on their parent’s health insurance plans until age 26.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is meaningless. In reality, the two sides are fighting for polar opposite plans. Democrats want to strengthen and expand the Obamacare markets to bring in more people, which could drive down prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans want to open up off-market options, allowing healthy people to move to cheaper but skimpier plans. They oppose most Obamacare regulations, as well as the taxes and subsidies that keep the individual markets stable. Obamacare regulations raise premium costs, but they also ensure that plans cover a wide range of services and people with health problems are charged at the same rate as everyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOP plans to repeal Obamacare were consistently projected to lead to millions more uninsured people and much higher premiums for people with preexisting health conditions, albeit while saving the government up to hundreds of billions of dollars. The projections sparked such a backlash that Republicans ultimately failed to deliver on their long-promised repeal of Obamacare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said that Republicans would be forced to decide between a plan that is essentially Obamacare or “some fig leaf nonsense that won’t cover anybody.” Democrats consistently rejected the idea of agreeing to a plan that would cause millions more uninsured people.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fantasy world the Republicans continue to live in on health care is a sight to behold,” said Sen. Chris Murphy. “They controlled every branch of government for two years and they couldn’t do anything on health care. Why on earth would we be able to restore the full protections in the Affordable Care Act with divided government?”\n",
      "\n",
      "A group of Republicans led by Sen. Mitt Romney have started having discussions about an Obamacare replacement plan that would involve block granting for health care funding to the states. However, these talks are in early stages and there is no timeline to produce legislation, according to someone with knowledge of the discussions. The talks have not extended to Democrats, who strongly oppose block grants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just two Republican senators have been firmly critical of the lawsuit: Susan Collins of Maine and Senate Health Committee Chair Lamar Alexander.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another option is that even if the Supreme Court tosses out Obamacare in 2020, the Trump administration could ask the court to delay the ruling taking effect until after the presidential election. This would set up an election where the White House and both chambers of Congress are up for grabs at a time when the health insurance of potentially tens of millions of people is on the line.\n",

      "\n",
      "The closures, which impact people whose immigration status is uncertain in dozens of courts across the country, has led to cases being indefinitely delayed and has further added to the already record-setting backlogs and years-long wait times, immigration legal experts told ABC News.\n",

      "Immigration judges already face a heavy burden dealing with the current caseload, said Amiena Khan, an immigration judge who serves as vice president at the National Association of Immigration Judges.\n",

      "\n",
      "Though immigration courts, which operate under the Department of Justice, continues to handle cases for detained migrants, the majority of people who face pending deportation proceedings are not detained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clients of immigration lawyer Jeremy McKinney may have to wait a full year before the court can even set a later date for a judge to assess the case, McKinney said. Two of his clients, who were supposed to appear Wednesday, had their court dates canceled.\n",

      "“You have to give this court system proper resources and proper integrity for it to do its job,” McKinney said.\n",

      "However, the case delays pose a further challenge to the Trump administration's efforts to expedite deportation processes and crackdown on illegal immigration.\n",

      "In the past year, the backlog of immigration court cases has surpassed one million, according to Department of Justice data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.\n",

      "\n",
      "Even if the courts reopened tomorrow, cases with dates that took place during the shutdown would have to be rescheduled – potentially months later – since immigration judges have their calendars booked far in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extra time to establish family roots by getting married or waiting for case law to be decided in federal court could offer more options for avoiding removal, according to legal experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When it comes to victims of domestic violence and gang-based crime the law has been thrown into turmoil … having a delay of game for those individuals, that’s not bad news,” McKinnley told ABC News.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for some immigrants with weak legal cases, the delay buys time in the US before they are deported.\n",
      "\n",
      "One possible solution to helping relieve the backlog is a fundamental restructuring of how such courts are funded and resourced, Khan said. This method would include removing courts from the executive branch where they are currently under the purview of the Department of Justice and creating a system where the courts function and are funded more independently.\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite efforts by some to frame EU legislative elections set for May 23-26 as a referendum on immigration policies, European citizens are not preoccupied by the issue, according to a European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) study conducted by the YouGov polling firm and released Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey of 45,000 people across 14 EU countries takes in 80 percent of European Parliament seats, providing an enlightening snapshot of EU public opinion. Only 23 percent of those polled cited immigration as one of the two most important issues facing their country at the moment – a figure comparable to the proportion citing unemployment (20 percent), the cost of living (18 percent), health (17 percent) and corruption (16 percent).\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most European leaders blindly subscribed to the idea that immigration was European citizens’ one and only preoccupation, but that’s a myth,” ECFR political analyst Pawel Zerka told FRANCE 24 on Monday. Zerka says that most of those surveyed did not note any effect of migration on their own lives, their jobs, their national identity or their personal security. It was only their perception of migration's impact on crime and security at the country-wide level that a majority of citizens deemed its overall effects to be negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only Hungarians ranked migration as the top threat to the EU, which is “little wonder given the endless stream of propaganda that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban puts out through his state-controlled media”, according to ECFR director Mark Leonard.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, when the spectre of emigration is raised – people leaving their countries to settle elsewhere – more Hungarians (39 percent) and Italians (32 percent) say they are worried, despite the fiery rhetoric from Orban and Italy’s vehemently anti-migrant Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same goes for Spain (34 percent), and Romania (55 percent) and Poland (30 percent) farther east.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is one of the main revelations of our study: Emigration is a concern that must be addressed,” says Zerka.\n",

      "Among the countries that worry most about emigration, a majority of those surveyed said they would even support legislation to prevent citizens from leaving their countries for extended periods of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a Europe that prides itself on tearing down borders and promoting free travel, this move towards self-imprisonment is remarkable, but perhaps understandable,” Leonard writes. “In Romania, one in five citizens have left their country over the last decade.\" He said those left behind feel so desperate that they seem ready to construct new barriers for themselves, just three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issues surrounding immigration are nevertheless likely to resurface during the European legislative campaign period. Far-right parties will likely seek to exploit the sentiments of the 22 percent of those polled who see “Islamic radicalism” as the top threat hanging over Europe by attempting to fuse the issues of radicalisation and immigration.\n",

      "\n",
      "The most common age for Latino Americans, in 2019: 11 years old. For black Americans and Asian Americans, it's 27 and 29, respectively; for multiracial Americans, it's 3 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is just another way of describing the well-known demographic shift at play in the United States: After the baby boomer generation, America has steadily been getting less \"white\" and more diverse. White Americans still make up most of the population, but birthrates between white and non-white Americans have now reached parity: 40% of the country now identifies as one of these supposed \"minorities,\" and the number is increasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message in the numbers is that the Republican Party play of stoking Fox News-ian panic over non-white Americans in order to drive old racists and not-quite-racists-but to the polls still has clout to it. They have squarely aimed their cultural panic at the baby boomer generation, now old and voting reliably and in absolute droves, even at the price of alienating almost everyone else. But the strategy has the same cholesterol and heart and lower back problems that their target population does: It has an expiration date, and it is rapidly approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who grew up in the era when minority Americans were segregated out to the sidelines are steadily dying off and non-white Americans are, just as steadily, taking their place. Their own voting and policy preferences will begin to drive the national debate; the days in which a proudly racist bioluminescent blowhole like Trump can attract more voters to the Republican Party than he repulses are, no matter how successful future Republican strategizing might be, at an end.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we've harped on this before as well, but that is precisely why the current incarnation of the Republican Party, a body that is now almost exclusively white, rural, and racist, has lurched into a new anti-democratic extremism in attempts to fill the judicial ranks and other government posts with white, archconservative allies; has engaged in now-panicked efforts to restrict the voting rolls and carve out majority-white districts out of increasingly non-white communities; and has begun to scream absolute bloody murder about the dangers of non-white Americans and immigrants via increasingly conspiratorial Fox News programs, rabble-rousing \"populist\" speeches, and other overt forays into white nationalism.\n",

      "Every action Sen. Mitch McConnell and the party's other top leaders take is in service to staving off that day for as long as possible. The most conservative possible judges are being installed, and non-conservative judges blocked, so that new voter initiatives and newly emerging public norms can be tossed by fiat, as necessary, for however many decades each new human sandbag can hold out.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that means embracing the most rotten possible of allies, forgiving the most loathsome of behaviors, and outright ignoring a dozen different crimes, it is all being stomached in order to whittle down as much of democracy as can be whittled down before the Republican racist coalition gets put into overly ornate urns and lost among their children's belongings.\n",

      "\n",
      " On Friday March 15, a suspected perpetrator of a massacre taking place at two mosques in Christchurch New Zealand is said to have killed 50 people in what is being regarded as one of the biggest mass shootings involving Muslim victims taking place in a western country. However, in the wake of New Zealand’s worst-ever domestic terror attack, a number of important unanswered questions still remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of Saturday, some 39 people remain hospitalized, 11 of who are still in critical condition in intensive care. A four-year-old child is also said to be in a critical condition and was flown to the children’s Starship hospital in Auckland. According to Christchurch hospital’s chief of surgery, Dr Greg Robertson, many of the victims may require multiple surgeries afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary suspect in this anti-Muslim terrorist attack is said to 28 year old Brenton Harrison Tarrant (image, left), an Australian citizen from New South Wales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tarrant has since been charged with murder and remanded in custody to appear again on April 5. According to news reports – he did not enter a plea.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of Saturday, Police have said they cannot confirm for certain that Tarrant was working alone, but they will likely have some definitive statement on this aspect of the case in the coming days.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to multiple reports, the main perpetrator of the massacre is said to have “teased on Twitter,” and ‘announced’ his attack on the message board 8chan (see image below).\n",
      "\n",
      "Brenton Tarrant is said to have authored a 74 page ‘Manifesto’ which seems to be mix of right-wing rhetoric, anti-immigrant polemics and some self-contradictory commentary about left vs right politics in the US, as well as an ode to various online ‘Alt-Right’ internet personalities like Candace Owens (he states, in his manifesto, that she had influenced him “above all”). Most western mainstream media outlets have already classifying his manifesto as a document for “white nationalism,” and “meant to troll” his political opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shooter has also triggered a potential crisis for Silicon Valley when he livestreamed his attack on Facebook (see some clips from his livestream in Nine News clip below), where he shot and killed dozens worshipers during Friday prayer at two mosques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictably, this spectacle aspect of the event has prompted calls for increased regulations of video livestreaming on social media, and pressure on companies like Facebook to ‘do more to stop extremism’ and censor political content. On Friday, Facebook Inc shares plunged 5% to their lowest in nearly three months – at the very same time as a surprise departure by their Chief Product Officer Chris Cox.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington Post reported that there was in fact a second and third man allegedly involved with the attack, 18-year-old Daniel John Burrough, who was scheduled to appear in court Saturday and charged with “inciting racial hostility or ill-will.”  This same report also states that a third accomplice remained unidentified as of Friday evening, Eastern Time.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, according to a report by The Guardian, PM Ardern has said the investigation was ongoing but authorities believed there was only “one primary perpetrator”.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN’s reporting on March 15 also clearly indicated there were multiple shooters:\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the shooters appears to have livestreamed the attack on Facebook (FB). The disturbing video, which has not been verified by CNN, ran for nearly 17 minutes and purportedly shows the gunman walking into a mosque and opening fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did CNN report multiple shooters so early in the coverage of this event? If this was not the case, and there is only one shooter, then how could a news agency at large and well-resourced as CNN (or any other large outlet for that matter) misreport a detail so crucial to what is clearly the world’s biggest story?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not just guns in the shooter’s car, but also IED’s as well, one of which was deactivated by police and which was said to be attached to the “suspects” (plural – according to Washington Post) vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“New Zealand police said they arrested three people in connection with the shootings. Authorities consider Brenton Harrison Tarrant, an Australian national, the primary suspect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: According to Police, 2 other suspects arrested, one man and one woman, appear to not have been involved in the shooting. The female has been released, but the male suspect remains in custody and a possible unrelated charge for unlawful possessing of a firearm. A fourth armed suspected was arrested whilst helping school children to safety. Police do not believe that either of these additional 3 suspects were involved in the incident.\n",

      "Multiple guns are said to have been used in this attack, including two semi-automatic weapons and two shotguns, totally some five different firearms altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her statement to the press, New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stated that the suspect was “the offender was in possession of a gun license. I can tell you one thing right now – our gun laws will change.”\n",

      "Parkland Student Flown in from US to Help Agitate for Gun Control\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the political reaction to the Christchurch Attack,the gun control issue has been elevated again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2018, student activists from the US were deployed to New Zealand to help generate media coverage for gun control issue. Reports state that some 28 students from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, USA, spent a week with New Zealand’s “Student Volunteer Army,” which was set up following the Christchurch earthquake in 2011. According to reports, Parkland survivors are coming “to share their experiences of living through a tragedy.” Student Volunteer Army president Josh Blackmore, told Morning Report that the high school students ‘were inspiring’ and that they were looking forward to welcoming them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This part of a global effort: “More than 800 protests were planned throughout the United States and abroad, with solidarity events taking place in Edinburgh, London, Geneva, Sydney and Tokyo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Why was New Zealand chosen as a venue for the 2018 Parkland campaign?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Parkland School Shooting took place approximately one year ago in February 2018, with numerous students killed and injured in that attack. But the tragedy quickly descended into a media-driven political campaign with accusations of astroturfing as critics accusing Democratic Party operatives and media outlets like CNN and MSNBC of using the students not only to gain political leverage by using the gun issue in such an emotive setting – but also as a platform to help register Democratic Party voters for the upcoming 2018 Midterm Elections in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the confusion about multiple arrests, there are also competing narratives in the media about which extremist camp which protagonist Tarrant belongs to. Most media outlets are framing Tarrant as a “White Supremacist” due to the symbolism which has appeared in a loose collection of extremist writings, internet ranting, free association comments, and images – in what the media are calling a “manifesto”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictably, CNN’s Don Lemon and Max Boot were pinning the blame on Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "His weapon was scrawled with neo-Nazi symbols and the names of white right-wing extremists who had killed others because of their ethnicity or faith. A manifesto released online laid his motivations out to bare: to kill Muslim immigrants. Seven other people were killed at another mosque nearby, bringing the toll of the two attacks to 49 people, a brutal act of terrorism that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a closer look into the symbolism in his paraphernalia reveals a real possibility of connections to right-wing fascist militant groups based in Ukraine – part of the same NeoNazi and fascist movement which was given political and material backing by the Obama Administration and John McCain in order to help carry out Washington’s violent coup in Kiev in February 2014. In this scenario, it’s possible that Tarrant could have been radicalized overseas and also online.\n",
      "\n",
      ".\n",
      "\n",
      " Apparently, Tarrant also made the reference “For Rotherham” on his ammunition clips (pictured above), a nod to the UK town of which was the sight of the ‘Rotherham Asian Grooming‘ sex abuse scandal, one of the stories championed by infamous British right-wing political actor Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon). Other references to right-wing criminal folklore were also made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Top ranked US talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has attempted to flip this theory, claiming that Tarrant is a leftist agitator trying to discredit the right:\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s an ongoing theory that the shooter himself may in fact be a leftist who writes the manifesto and then goes out and performs the deed purposely to smear his political enemies, knowing he’s going to get shot in the process.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More than any other single mass shooting or terrorist event in recent years, the Christchurch event closely resembles the 2011 Norway Massacre carried out by right-wing Mason, Templar and Christian Zionist, Anders Breivik (Note: Breivik was also linked to Tommy Robinson, see here and here) were he massacred 77 members of Norway’s Young Labour Party at a Workers’ Youth League (AUF) summer camp (Note that Young Labor were dedicated supporters of Palestinian at that time and opposed the Israeli occupation).\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like Breivik’s 2012 Norway Attack,  Tarrant’s Christchurch event also featured two separate venues on the same day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, both men are said to have prepared a manifesto before their operations. In Tarrant’s 74-page document posted online, he claims to want to create “an atmosphere of fear” which would incite Muslims and trigger a right-wing counter-reactions, but then turns to say “CONSERVATISM IS DEAD, THANK GOD.” This is just one of the many nonsensical twists and turns in this seemingly incoherent ‘manifesto.’  The document also pays homage to American Dylann Roof and other mass shooters, and seemed to infer that Tarrant himself had had received Breivik’s “blessing” for this latest mass shooting and terrorist attack in Christchurch.\n",
      "\n",
      "As 21WIRE reported back in 2011, the Norway Massacre was a catalyst for extremist right-wing fascism and  terrorism, and that future extremists like Tarrant would indeed be inspired by the bravado of Breivik.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted also that in the case of Breivik, his initial processing and police interview was held in secret and not recorded, and therefore no public record of what was said can be analyzed. Similarly with the Christchurch Shooting, hearings on the Saturday were held in closed session with Judge Paul Keller denying any open, public access, supposedly “in the interest of safety” — an unusual move for New Zealand courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the high-profile mass shootings and terror attacks in recent years have featured a leading actor who was a “known wolf” – some one who was already ‘on the radar’ of the security services as a known extremist or informant, as opposed to a merely a lone wolf. This does not appear to be the case in Christchurch. According to reports, authorities in both Australia and New Zealand did not have Tarrant listed on any counter-terrorism watch list, despite the currently theory that he was planning the attack for several years.\n",

      "One of the regular techniques employed by western governments and their media functionaries to successfully deflect any public criticism for illegal operations in Syria – has been to frame Coalition bombing campaigns as “targeting ISIS controlled areas.”\n",

      "This especially includes the framing of the US-led Coalition’s relentless firebombing of Raqqa in northeastern Syria in 2017. Far from destroying ISIS in Raqqa, the US and its proxy militias, the Kurdish SDF forces – had already allowed hundreds of the top ISIS terrorist militants and officers to escape the city – even allowing them to take their arms with them. This was even admitted by the BBC. After this operation was complete, the US Coalition waged the bulk of their bombing campaign on the city, proceeding to slaughter at least 3,000 Syrian civilians in the process, including entire families who were wiped out by Coalition carpet munitions. The media turned a convenient blind eye at the time by following the US State Dept dictates that the US was simply “bombing ISIS.”  To this day, the US are still in denial about their reckless operation and mass civilian slaughter in Raqqa.\n",

But this was no ordinary fika, or coffee break. Several women from the 4th Flotilla of the Swedish Navy were gathered on Sept. 18, 2018, 10 months after the November 2017 launch of the Swedish military’s #MeToo movement—called #givaktochbitihop, which loosely translates to “stand at attention and bite the bullet”—when more than 3,000 incidents of abuse in the armed forces over the past 30 years were detailed on one Facebook page.\n",

      "Though the military’s top-down response to #givaktochbitihop was perceived as unequivocal—the supreme commander, Air Force Gen. Micael Byden, addressed a harsh video message to perpetrators—true culture change must happen organically. To that end, Swedish troops themselves have also been bringing about change among the rank and file.\n",
      "\n",
      "A group of about 50 female sailors, out of about 400 total in the 4th Flotilla, have long been one another’s strongest supporters. They formed GRYM, an acronym that in Swedish stands for Community, Recruitment, Career guidance, and Mentorship, but can also translate to “cruel,” “savage,” or “ferocious.” This flotilla’s GRYM chapter was formed four years ago by its former commander Rear Adm. Ewa Skoog Haslum, the first female admiral in the Swedish Navy. The group encourages women to trade career planning advice, information on what to do when you’ve been harassed, and tips for balancing work and family (egalitarian Sweden offers 480 days of family leave per child for all citizens).\n",
      "\n",
      "GRYM members also act as informal sounding boards for survivors of sexual harassment or assault. This is of particular use to those wary of official reporting. “It’s hard to be anonymous,” said Lt. Mia Rismalm, a member of the group. Nor do all women need the same thing. Skoog Haslum said she herself never needed women’s networks or female role models. Now deputy vice chancellor at the Swedish Defense University, she acknowledged some survivors prefer an empathetic conversation to an incident being brought to trial. Swedish law, she said, mandates investigation of reported incidents but doesn’t dictate how the commander must perform them. Skoog Haslum tries to reassure skittish subordinates that she “will never do something that [a complainant] doesn’t want to do. Never.”\n",

About nine years ago, a drunken senior male colleague mistook her conversational tone for attraction during a talk about relationships at a shipboard Christmas party. Though alcohol wasn’t supposed to be served past midnight, most flaunted that rule. Landberg, sober, left early to prepare for a morning duty shift. When the senior colleague banged on her stateroom door several times that night, she waved him away, chalking it up to his inebriation. Around 3 a.m., she woke to the chilling click of her door locked from the inside. The male officer, completely naked, tried to drag her out of her upper bunk. Fighting to escape, she felt his penis against her back. She persuaded him to leave, saying her male roommate would arrive soon, and locked him out. When her roommate returned, he accompanied her to wake up other sailors and report the incident. Within 12 hours, Landberg was giving testimony to her command.\n",
      "\n",
      "One junior enlisted sailor, the daughter of a Swedish Navy mine diver who asked to be identified by her first name, Malin, felt obligated to report her assault, a smack on her bottom that happened while she was changing into uniform. After the #givaktochbitihop campaign revealed the number of incidents buried for decades, she wanted to encourage other women who had been harassed to take that step as well and convey the message that reporting was not only okay, but necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while Sweden has been admirable in its approach, women often face social isolation after they report, as the rumor mill aboard ship speculates about their harassment or assault. Landberg said the colleague who assaulted her “was a good friend of so many.” She feared he’d told a version of his side of the story to everyone else. Further complicating her experience was that her command expected her to be immediately sure of what she wanted to do after she testified, but she was still processing the shock. In the end, the alleged perpetrator, who claimed to have no memory of the incident, was denied higher education. He then left the Navy.\n",
      "\n",
      "For her part, Malin—who said her commanders were “very supportive”—felt out of the loop as her complaint made its way through Swedish military bureaucracy. Her relationship with colleagues changed, too; in the sailors’ mess, “it would be quiet when I would sit around the table … they wouldn’t want to joke around with me. It was really different,” she said. These dynamics make for a complicated balance between fitting in and speaking up aboard tightknit ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Malin’s emotional support came from her closest female colleague, whom she explained she “really trusted,” no one in Landberg’s all-male crew asked her how she felt. Though their assailants were punished, “There’s one thing I think men don’t understand,” Landberg said, “and that is how you feel afterwards.” She had the sense that the unspoken narrative around her was, “‘Now they have their punishment, they have money taken away, so it’s fine! Now he’s not working here anymore, so get over it!’ But,” she added, she’s still wary, especially when aboard ship with drunk comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not just these women’s own experiences that have left lasting impressions. Malin said that friends’ similar stories have made her “always on guard” when she goes out on the town with colleagues. Though her male crewmates do not share the same fears of sexual trauma, Malin said plenty of them have empathized with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Swedish military’s occupational health service offers counseling services for both survivors and perpetrators, and it can also refer troops to civilian providers. But one further lesson of the #givaktochbitihop outcry is that it’s crucial for all troops to learn basic communication skills. For example, Landberg’s attacker drunkenly assumed a deep discussion about relationships meant she was willing sexual prey. But, of course, just because someone talks about feelings with you doesn’t mean she wants to sleep with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this was eye-opening for Filippa Gode, a Navy cook who was in boot camp when #givaktochbitihop started (and therefore heard little about it). “I think men support men in Sweden, whatever happens … we [women] have to listen to each other and support each other,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, that sexual harassment and assault are now discussed openly is a huge change from 15 months ago, before #givaktochbitihop broke the silence and denial that had previously permeated the Swedish Armed Forces. And then there’s that group—GRYM. It provides women—survivor and otherwise—sisterhood and support, coworkers and colleagues, as well as space to speak and learn. It’s not just women supporting women, though. While Malin, a former youth Sea Scout, said she remained in the Navy because of “these fantastic women” she has also seen over the last year a noticeable change in the culture of her male colleagues: In the wake of #givaktochbitihop, both the witness to her assault and the colleague who encouraged her to report it were men.\n",

      "Content Sample: Lansing, MI — In January, temperatures in Lansing, Michigan plummeted far below freezing making it extremely dangerous for those who are homeless. Knowing people would likely freeze to death if they stayed outside, one couple decided to help out those less fortunate than them. However, instead of being praised for their good deed, the couple was arrested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia Miller and Martin Mashon were handing out bus tokens in January so that homeless people could go to the bus station instead of staying outside and freezing to death. They are advocates for the less fortunate and during weather emergencies like this one, they often hand out coats and help people make it to warming centers. But on this particular day, the police would show up to put a halt to their kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "On January 26, during a polar vortex and weather emergency, temperatures had fallen well below zero so Mashon and Miller went to the CATA station to hand out tokens and try to save lives. But body camera footage shows that police showed up and acted like the couple was robbing the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This isn’t a warming station, it’s a bus station so there’s no loitering,” the officer says after he ran up to the couple like there was some sort of emergency.\n",

      "“But it’s a great place for people to stay warm,” said Mashon.\n",

      "According to many folks who have commented on the video, the director of the CATA bus station has an open door policy during cold weather and allows the less fortunate to “loiter” in the station to stay warm. However, it appears that the police wanted nothing of it.\n",

      "The officer then throws Mashon up against the window and puts him in handcuffs. Moments later he arrests Miller as well. Miller was charged with trespassing and Mashon was charged with trespassing and hindering an officer. Miller explained that they plan on fighting the charges and are asking for the police to apologize as well as implement a policy for helping the homeless during weather emergencies. “Don’t they understand that if they A. Drop all charges against both Martin and myself. B. Offer a public apology in regards to the excessive force and verbiage the officer used and C. Implement a plan of action that involves several local homeless advocacy groups in regards to what needs to be done during weather emergencies that the chances of us deciding to pursue a civil suit will lessen AND it will save them some face,” Miller wrote on Facebook.

      "Content Sample: Imagine that you are the czar of all building in San Francisco, and that you have been asked for your thoughts on the design of a new apartment building that is under consideration. What is your top concern?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a halfway competent and benevolent dictator — and, goodness knows, history has shown us few enough of those! — then you’d probably put “affordability” at the top of your list. The people of San Francisco and the surrounding areas are very much in need of new affordable housing: In the city itself, the median price of a house is now just over $1.6 million, more than 16 times the median household income. Affordable housing is a big issue not only for regular middle-class people but for the high-tech titans of Silicon Valley, who worry that some highly productive potential employees are looking elsewhere for their futures, not to mention that the housing market forces them to pay more for all their workers. There are other places that have faced such problems, notably resort communities such as Aspen, Colo., but it is unusual for a major city to become so comprehensively unaffordable. Even famously expensive New York City has its more affordable enclaves, without which many industries — from food-service to publishing — would have enormous human-capital problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the czar of building in San Francisco were presented with a design for the most affordable apartment building that possibly could be built (for the purpose of our thought experiment, there is no building code), he almost certainly would reject it, because it would lack certain health and safety features that most of us regard as essential. It probably would not be very attractive or very energy-efficient. It probably would not be very comfortable to live in, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "A different building czar might believe instead that energy efficiency is the most important concern. But if he were presented with a design for the most energy-efficient building that possibly could be built, he almost certainly would reject it, because it would lack things that most of us regard as essential, like windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "What if we put safety and health first? We might say we want the maximum affordability consistent with safety and health. But even seemingly obvious concerns such as safety eventually put us in a bind: At some point, we will encounter a marginal improvement to safety that forces us to accept compromises in affordability, energy efficiency, or some other criterion that seems to us excessive or unreasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the building czar making up a list of things that are legitimately important in the design of such a project might, off the top of his head, jot down: affordability, health and safety (which might very well include concerns ranging from fire and earthquakes to crime and terrorism), energy efficiency, accessibility for disabled people, comfort, aesthetics, externalities such as traffic and parking, any likely effects on neighboring residents and businesses, utility loads (a big concern for New York, lately), and a few other things. Some of these concerns are complementary: A building that is more energy efficient will demand less of its utility providers; a building that is well integrated into the mass-transit network will need less parking and contribute less to traffic, etc. But other concerns will clash: Many beautiful buildings sacrifice energy efficiency to aesthetics; some safety and accessibility features consume both energy and money; the cost difference between making a building very durable in an earthquake and making it very, very durable in an earthquake may be very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of those tradeoffs will impose costs, some of which might not be obvious until you are faced with an unusual or extreme circumstance. There wasn’t anything defective about the design of the World Trade Center towers, which very likely would have stood up just fine in the event of an ordinary fire or many kinds of possible terrorist attack. But they were not designed to stand up to having jetliners flown into them, even though the question had, oddly enough, come up when the project was being conceived in the 1960s.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you want your apartment building to be affordable, but you also want it to be safe — from what? Ordinary building fires? Terrorist attacks? Meteors? Earthquakes? Okay: How big an earthquake? You want it to be green, but you also want it to be attractive and comfortable. You want it to have few enough entrances to be secure but enough exits for people to get out quickly during a fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s one building, and one building gets pretty complicated all by itself. When you move into the larger realm of the entire housing stock of a city such as San Francisco, the problem gets exponentially more complex. As the locals sometimes like to remind us, the Bay Area is home to an enormous concentration of intelligence, engineering expertise, human capital, and ordinary capital, too. But for all those resources, it has made zero progress toward its goal of making housing more affordable. And there isn’t anything nefarious behind that: It is a complex problem and would be even if everybody had exactly the same preferences and priorities — which, as it turns out, they don’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is to say: The things that make people want to put czars in charge of complicated and intractable problems are also the things that make it a terrible idea to put czars in charge of complicated and intractable problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "If designing an apartment building is complex, then how much more complex is designing, say, a national system of regulating and subsidizing health-insurance companies, medical providers, employers, state governments, and — oh! — just about every one of the 327.2 million residents of this country from sea to shining sea, in a way that optimizes at least a few hundred major criteria that are in many cases either rivalrous or incompatible? How much more complicated than that is reorganizing more or less the entirety of human economic activity in simultaneous pursuit of environmental and social-justice goals involving competing factors so complex that the relationships among them are literally incomprehensible?\n",
      "\n",
      "The same bureaucracies and politician-dominated processes we expect to ensure substantial justice for the entirety of the human race while optimizing the sum of human material life in accord with certain slippery and vaguely defined environmental goals cannot figure out how to raise an apartment building in San Francisco — which in reality entails not figuring out how to develop the needed housing but how to let other people who want to use their own money and energy to develop that housing do so — or how to run a high school in Milwaukee, or how to ensure that all of the people on Death Row actually belong there. The federal government cannot even say with any confidence how many programs it currently administers. Don’t ask its auditors where the money went.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the Instagram-ready chin-up posturing and declarations of moral urgency in the world will not change the facts of problems before us or render inoperative Immanuel Kant’s maxim that “ought implies can.” The adjectives “ambitious,” “inspiring,” “audacious,” and “sweeping” should be met with dread by those who value boring things like reason, responsibility — and reality.\n",

      "Content Sample: Actually I thought I was sufficiently informed by the books of my friend Manfred Paulus about the shameful excesses of human trafficking and sex slavery. But his meritorious lifelong research is mainly related to Germany and Europe. An article by the American constitutional attorney John W. Whitehead in “Global Research” of 24 April 2019 “The Essence of Evil: Sex with Children Has Become Big Bussiness in America” shows that the sex trade – especially the purchase and sale of young girls  – has become “Big Business” in America. This buying and selling has become the fastest growing organized crime business and the second most important good after drugs and weapons. This is America’s dirty little secret. This decadent “Western Value Society” will one day perish like the decadent Roman Empire.\n",

      "\n",
      "I recommend to every reader of these lines – especially parents and educators – to read the shocking state report of American society here in order to form their own opinion. In the following I quote from the report. Whitehead portrays a frighteningly decadent nation. Already in 2015 he published a book entitled “Battlefield America. The War on the American People”. It is estimated that there are 100,000 to 150,000 under-aged child sex workers in the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average age of those being trafficked is 13. But the average means there are children younger than 13. That means 8-, 9-, 10-year-old. Every year, the girls being bought and sold gets younger and younger. Every two minutes, a child is exploited in the sex industry. According to USA Today, adults purchase children for sex at least 2.5 million times a year in the United States. They are ordinary people from all walks of life, including men in socially respected professions such as doctors and pastors. On average, a child might be raped by 6.000 men during a five-year period of servitude. It’s happening everywhere, right under our nose, in suburbs, cities and towns across the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those trafficked, it’s a nightmare from beginning to the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "These girls aren’t volunteering to be sex slaves. Some of these children are forcefully abducted or lured by force. Many are runaways or throwaways, others are sold to the system by relatives and acquaintances. In most cases, they have no choice. Social media makes it all too easy for pimps to find girls. They look on MySpace, Facebook, and other social networks. They and their assistants cruise malls, high schools and middle schools. They pick them up at bus stops. Foster homes and youth shelters have also become prime targets for traffickers. It is a “trading of flesh”.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the victims of human trafficking, it’s a nightmare from beginning to the end. A living nightmare of endless rape, forced drugging, degradation, threats, disease, pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages, torture, pain, and always the constant fear of being killed. They were frequently beaten to keep them off-balance and obedient. Every night they would have to meet a certain quota. Sometimes they were videotaped while being forced to have sex with adults or one another. In a so-called “damage group”, the clients can hit them or do anything they want to.\n",

      "\n",
      "So what can you do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitehead answers the self-imposed question: “So what can you do? with a series of detailed practical recommendations. I quote some that I have translated:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Educate yourselves and your children about this growing menace in our communities. Stop feeding the monster: Sex trafficking is part of a larger continuum in America that runs the gamut from homelessness, poverty, and self-esteem issues to sexualized television, the glorification of a pimp/ho culture—what is often referred to as the pornification of America—and a billion dollar sex industry built on the back of pornography, music, entertainment, etc. This epidemic is largely one of our own making, especially in a corporate age where the value placed on human life takes a backseat to profit. It is estimated that the porn industry brings in more money than Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Yahoo. Call on your city councils, elected officials and police departments to make the battle against sex trafficking a top priority, more so even than the so-called war on terror and drugs and the militarization of law enforcement. (…)  That so many women and children continue to be victimized, brutalized and treated like human cargo is due to three things: one, a consumer demand that is increasingly lucrative for everyone involved—except the victims; two, a level of corruption so invasive on both a local and international scale that there is little hope of working through established channels for change; and three, an eerie silence from individuals who fail to speak out against such atrocities. But the truth is that we are all guilty of contributing to this human suffering. The traffickers are guilty. The consumers are guilty. The corrupt law enforcement officials are guilty. The women’s groups who do nothing are guilty. The foreign peacekeepers and aid workers who contribute to the demand for sex slaves are guilty. Most of all, every individual who does not raise a hue and cry over the atrocities being committed against women and children in almost every nation around the globe—including the United States—is guilty.\n",

      "\n",
      "New measurements, aided by an international network of 3,900 floats deployed in the oceans since 2000, showed more warming since 1971 than calculated by the latest UN assessment of climate change in 2013, the researchers said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Man-made greenhouse gas emissions are warming the atmosphere, according to the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, and a large part of the heat gets absorbed by the oceans. That in turn is forcing fish to flee to cooler waters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought,\" said co-author Zeke Hausfather, a graduate student in the Energy and Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 93 percent of excess heat - trapped around the Earth by greenhouse gases that come from the burning of fossil fuels - accumulates in the world's oceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest report relied on four studies, published between 2014 and 2017, that gave more precise estimates of past trends in ocean heat, allowing scientists to update past research and hone predictions for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key factor in the more accurate numbers is an ocean monitoring fleet called Argo, which includes nearly 4,000 floating robots that \"drift throughout the world's oceans, every few days diving to a depth of 2,000 metres  and measuring the ocean's temperature, pH, salinity and other bits of information as they rise back up\", said the report.\n",

      "\"While 2018 will be the fourth warmest year on record on the surface, it will most certainly be the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that,\" Hausfather said.\n",

      "Overall, temperatures in the ocean down to 2,000 metres rose about 0.1C from 1971-2010, he told Reuters news agency. The 2013 United Nations assessment estimated slower rates of heat uptake but did not give a single comparable number.\n",

Analysts at KeyBanc investment services estimated the stoppage cut GM vehicle production by 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles. That's too much for the company to make up with overtime or increased assembly line speeds. Analysts say the costs to GM will hit around $2 billion.\n",

      "Content Sample: (RNS) — On a Sunday morning in May of 1969, as clergy processed into the sanctuary of New York’s august Riverside Church, civil rights activist James Forman vaulted into the pulpit to demand $500 million in reparations for the mistreatment of African Americans from white churches and synagogues.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, Forman’s interruption represented the high point for the reparations movement. A week before, Forman had debuted a radical proposal for racial justice known as “the Black Manifesto” for 500 black activists gathered in Detroit for the National Black Economic Development Conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“(W)e know that the churches and synagogues have a tremendous wealth,” the manifesto stated, “and its membership, white America, has profited and still exploits black people.\n",
      "\n",
      "”The conference determined, by a 187-63 vote, that it was time for white Christians and Jews to pay reparations and demonstrate a willingness to fight “the white supremacy and racism which has forced us as black people to make these demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "This content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "”Riverside, then a mostly white liberal Protestant congregation whose neo-Gothic landmark building was financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr., would be deeply divided over the next few years over Forman’s challenge. As the activist brought his manifesto to other congregations and denominations, Riverside established a lecture series and a “Fund for Social Justice” that aimed to raise $450,000 over three years to help the poor in the local community. It fell short of the goal by almost $100,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Black Manifesto’s demands never caught fire in the broader U.S. religious community. The Rev. Gayraud Wilmore, a black Presbyterian leader in New York City in 1969, recalled 50 years later how religious institutions responded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw them withering and unable to step forward and say ‘Let’s be the church,’” said Wilmore, now 98. “I saw no bold action taken on our side to go along with the bold action Forman was taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "”Five decades later, the reparations debate has reentered the national spotlight, with some religious institutions leading the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier in December, Reform Jews, declaring that “racial inequity is present in virtually every aspect of American life,” voted overwhelmingly to support a U.S. commission to develop proposals for reparations and urged conversations in their congregations to redress systemic racism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent months, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary and Georgetown University have all announced plans to fund initiatives that would benefit the descendants of slaves, while Episcopal dioceses in New York and Long Island made million- and half-million-dollar commitments as reparations committees continued their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May, the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland voted to study reparations and urge congregations to “examine how their endowed wealth is tied to the institution of slavery.\n",
      "\n",
      "”Maryland’s African American bishop, Eugene Taylor Sutton, said tears came to his eyes when the measure passed at the diocese’s general convention with no dissenting votes, and he realized that the assembled delegates, representing a membership that is 90% white, “got it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They get this thing called justice, and when you put it in a frame that there is a basic injustice in this nation of stealing from generations of people and that has a direct effect on today, then people,” Sutton said, “they say, 'OK, we got to get that fixed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "”Sutton, who testified before Congress in June with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates to advocate for the idea of a U.S. reparations commission, emphasized that reparations can come in many forms. Starting next month, members of his diocese will begin to consider options such as providing better access for people of color to home buying, job training and faculty positions at seminaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has taken some American religious institutions 50 years to get their heads around reparations. When Forman hijacked that Sunday morning service, two-thirds of Riverside worshippers, including the minister, stormed out in protest. After activists occupied offices in the Interchurch Center of New York, a court issued restraining orders to bar Forman from the building. In Missouri, manifesto supporters in St. Louis carried out a series of “Black Sunday” protests, interrupting local services, which led to confrontations with white church members and arrests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manifesto was quite specific in its demands. Black activists would control the distribution of reparations. The $500 million (soon increased to $3 billion) would be spent on programs designed to ensure black self-determination. These included establishing a Southern land bank, publishing industries, television networks, job training centers, labor unions and a black university.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manifesto’s rhetoric was just as controversial. Written by Forman, a former member of the civil rights group known as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the preamble framed reparations in Marxist terms. “Time is short,” Forman wrote. “(N)o oppressed people ever gained their liberation until they were ready to fight, to use whatever means necessary, including the use of force and power of the gun to bring down the colonizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "”Prominent black and white religious leaders diverged on how to interpret Forman’s call for revolution. The Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, who succeeded the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, compared Forman to biblical prophets who spoke truth to power. Writing in The Christian Century, he asked, “Was there not even a physical resemblance between Amos, the dusty-road-weary prophet in his desert garb, and Jim Forman in his dashiki?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The response from some white denominations was outright rejection. The Southern Baptist Convention dismissed the manifesto as “outrageous.” The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York called it un-American and touted its own programs for the “needy and disadvantaged” instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Jewish Committee, which as part of the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization had helped organize the National Black Economic Development Conference, withdrew from the IFCO. Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, IFCO’s first president, resigned, stating hecould not “in conscience stand by in silence and appear ... to give assent to the revolutionary ideology and racist rhetoric of the Black Manifesto.\n",
      "\n",
      "”Other denominations were more ambivalent. The Reformed Church in America invited Forman to address its general synod after he occupied the denomination’s headquarters a month after his action at Riverside. The Rev. Rand Peabody, a 22-year-old white seminarian who had already been slated to give the sermon the next day, revised his sermon after hearing news of Forman’s “liberation” of the RCA’s offices.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember I said it’s not a time for us to feel either blamed or shamed and certainly not a time to feel futile,” Peabody, now 73, said in an interview. “Our denomination, in his eye, did indeed have the power to play a part and we should accept that as almost a commissioning of the denomination to indeed step up to the plate and get involved in more focused and proactive ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "”Like other denominations, the RCA didn’t accede to Forman’s demand that reparations be handed over freely. Instead the synod voted to create a $100,000 fund “to be disbursed according to the decisions” of a newly formed Black Council. The council then rejected the money.“We just basically wanted to be at the table where decisions are being made and not considered an auxiliary or an offshoot or a secondhand portion of the denomination,” said the Rev. Dwayne Jackson, a Hackensack, New Jersey, pastor, who was a panelist at an RCA event commemorating the manifesto in October titled “Unfinished Business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson, who knew some members of the council from his childhood church in the Bronx, said the staffer hired to oversee the council was the church’s first black executive. (Today, people of color comprise a third of the RCA’s executive leadership team.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Other denominations acknowledged the grievances raised by the manifesto but rejected the solutions it proposed and even the language of “reparations.” Instead they created or continued programs aimed at helping poor blacks and others. The Presbyterian Committee on the Self-Development of People, the Evangelical Covenant Church’s Fund for Disadvantaged Americans of Minority Groups and the Episcopal Church’s General Convention Special Program were all created around the time of Forman’s action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dominique DuBois Gilliard, the current director of the ECC’s “racial righteousness and reconciliation” ministry, recently reflected on how this kind of response “enacted a very problematic erasure of the black freedom struggle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Met with the manifesto’s demands, “the Covenant found it more palatable to shift the conversation to marginalization in general,” Gilliard writes in the May/August edition of its Covenant Quarterly, which focused on the 50th anniversary of the manifesto. “This response has strong parallels to proclamations that ‘All Lives Matter’ in response to the declaration ‘Black Lives Matter.’\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been a shift in recent years, however, which Gilliard has helped encourage. The ECC Resolution on Racism, passed in June, insists that “the time is right for white clergy to attend to the sins of our own community and make a public commitment to prioritize antiracism work within our ministerium.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nell Gibson, a member and former chair of the Episcopal Diocese of New York’s Reparations Committee, recalled that in the wake of Forman’s declaration — which resulted in the Episcopal Church’s $200,000 donation to the National Committee of Black Churchmen — members of her Manhattan church created a Black and Brown Caucus. After receiving the $30,000 they demanded from their St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bowery, they developed a free breakfast program for children, a summer “liberation school” that taught minority children their ancestors’ history and a prison law library.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifty years on, reparations are often framed as spiritual tests as much as financial ones. This year was named the “Year of Apology” for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, and each Sunday Gibson’s congregation has said a prayer that includes this sentence: “For the many ways — social, economic and political — that white supremacy has accrued benefits to some of us at the expense of others, we repent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, the diocesan reparations committee will consider a number of possible next steps, such as a truth and reconciliation commission or education and health care initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, Sutton said his Maryland Episcopal diocese is moving methodically after years of conversation about reparations to figuring out how that will be lived out financially and otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t have all the solutions, we don’t know everything that’s going to fix the problem and so we’re going to be humble in even what we think we can accomplish,” he said. “But, by God, we’re going to do something.\n",

      "Original: Authorities are trying to determine if anyone helped two inmates who escaped from a California jail, traveled hundreds of miles and crossed into Mexico before being captured trying to walk back into the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonathan Salazar, 20, and Santos Fonseca, 21, were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at a port of entry in San Ysidro — the nation's largest border crossing — early Wednesday, Monterey County Sheriff's Office Capt. John Thornburg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thornburg said the two are in the custody of Monterey County officials and have been returned to a jail in Salinas, a farming city of about 160,000 people roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of San Francisco.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salazar and Fonseca escaped Sunday from the lockup in Salinas after climbing through a hole they made in the ceiling of a bathroom, squeezing through a hollow wall and kicking open a hatch. Officials found their jail-issued jumpsuits outside the building. Inmates often wear their own clothes under the jumpsuits, Thornburg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigators have not yet determined how long they worked on making the hole or if anyone else helped them escape or helped them after they were out. They were reported missing at 8:15 a.m. Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thornburg said authorities received a tip that the pair, both born and raised in Salinas, had been spotted in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, around 400 miles (644 kilometers) south of Monterey County, and alerted federal officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "CBP spokeswoman Jackie Wasiluk said the men didn't present any documents. They said they were U.S. citizens, and a check of law enforcement databases told border inspectors that they were wanted by authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "How the pair made it to Mexico, why they decided to travel together since they allegedly belong to rival gangs and why they returned to the United States is under investigation, Thornburg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The good news here is they are in custody again,\" Thornburg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salazar and Fonseca will be housed separately in a different housing unit from the one they escaped, Thornburg said, adding that officials had already made security improvements to the jail. He said he couldn't provide details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before being spotted in Tijuana, investigators received a credible tip from an employee at a motel in Marina about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the jail who told authorities Salazar had checked in there Tuesday morning, but authorities found no one in the room after a nearly eight-hour standoff, Thornburg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It all looked like we had Mr. Salazar in a motel,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, last night he wasn't there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both had been in custody since 2018 and were awaiting trial on murder counts and \"numerous other felony charges\" in separate cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salazar was arrested in the shooting death of 20-year-old Jaime Martinez as the victim drove in Salinas with his girlfriend and 18-month-old son. The woman was shot and treated at a hospital, while the child wasn't hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police investigated the Oct. 12, 2017, shooting as gang-related. Officers said his tattoos, including the letter P on his cheek, refer to his Sureño offshoot gang, La Posada Trece, the Californian reported. His trial was scheduled to begin in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fonseca told police after his arrest on homicide charges that his gang leader told him to kill someone to prove he was still loyal to the Boronda Boys, a subset of the Norteño gang, Detective Gabriela Contreras testified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fonseca is charged with shooting Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, to death on June 2, 2018, while the victim sat in his car on a video call with his wife in Mexico, the Californian reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw a scuffle, heard her husband screaming \"no\" and then gunshots rang out, Salinas police Officer Froylan Aranda said. Acosta was reportedly chosen at random.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days later, Fonseca shot and killed Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27, in a Salinas park, authorities said. He told police that the gang leader also ordered the slaying and that he picked his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend \"to send him a message,\" Contreras said.\n",
